    <title>Two Breakthroughs | Origins of Mind</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Two scientific breakthroughs that have recently furthered understanding of how knowledge might emerge in development. The first breakthrough is the discovery that preverbal infants enjoy surprisingly rich social abilities, abilities which may well be foundational for later linguistic abilities and enable the emergence of knowledge (e.g. Csibra &amp; Gergely 2009; Meltzoff 2007; Tomasello et al. 2005). A second breakthrough is the use of increasingly sensitive—-and sometimes controversial--methods to detect sophisticated expectations concerning causal interactions, numerosity, mental states and more besides in preverbal infants (e.g. Spelke 1990; Baillargeon et al. 2010)."/>

        <div class="notes">We will see that infants can tackle physics, number, agents and minds thanks to a set of 
innate or early-developing abilities, often labelled `core knowledge'.
        </div>
        <div class="slide nodim">
          <p>We don't understand it.</p>
          <div class="notes">For now, let us use the term `core knowledge' to mean whatever infants have concerning
the locations of particular objects which is not knowledge but which underpins their
abilities to discriminate between phyiscally possible and physically impossible
sitatuions where the difference between possibile and impossibile depends on facts about
objects the infants are not currently perceiving.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">It is important that we don't (yet) know what core knowledge is; `core knowledge' is a 
term of art. I haven't explained what it is.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">[*needs updating!]
Our position is this.
Some scientists talk about core knowledge, and formulate hypotheses in terms of it.
Since these hypotheses are supported by evidence, we can reasonably suppose they are true.
So there are some things we provisionally suppose are truths about core knowledge.
For instance, infants' core knowledge enables them to represent unperceived objects.
So we know some truths about core knowledge, but we don't know what it is.
You'd probably prefer it if I could tell you what core knowledge is first.
But here we have to work backwards.
We have to gather truths about this unknown thing, core knowledge.
And then we have to ask, What could core knowledge be given that these things are true?

          <div class="notes">Several features distinguish core knowledge from adult-like understanding: its content is 
unknowable by introspection and judgement-independent; it is specific to quite narrow 
categories of event and does not grow by means of generalization; it is best understood 
as a collection of rules rather than a coherent theory; and it has limited application 
being usually manifest in the control of attention (as measured by dishabituation, gaze, 
and looking times) and rarely or never manifest in purposive actions such as reaching.

These include imitation, which can occur just days and even minutes after birth 
(Meltzoff & Moore 1977; Field et al. 1982; Meltzoff & Moore 1983), imitative learning 
(Carpenter et al. 1998), gaze following (Csibra & Volein 2008), goal ascription 
(Gergely et al. 1995; Woodward & Sommerville 2000), social referencing (Baldwin 2000) 
and pointing (Liszkowski et al. 2006).
Taken together, the evidence reveals that preverbal infants have surprisingly rich 
social abilities.

              <div class="notes">Perhaps the best evidence how sophisticated infant social interaction can be comes
from studies of language creation. 
(This will be a key topic when we come to study knowledge of language, but let me 
give you a tiny preview.)
              </div>
              <div class="notes">Children with no experience of others' languages can create their own languages.
We know this from studies of profoundly deaf children brought up in purely oral 
environments and therefore without experience of language 
\citep{Kegl:1999es,Senghas:2001zm,Goldin-Meadow:2003pj}.
Individually or in groups these children invent their own signed languages.
These languages are not as rich as those of children with experience of other 
people's languages but they have all of the essential features of language 
including lexicons and syntax (*refs: Goldin-Meadow 2002, 2003).
The children invent gesture forms for words which they use with the same meanings 
in different contexts, they adopt standard orderings for combining words into 
sentences, and they use sentences in constructing narratives about past, present, 
future and hypothetical events (*ref: Goldin-Meadow 2003: 170).
              </div>
              <div class="notes">But it is not just children in extreme circumstances that create words.
Children in ordinary environments will create their own words before they learn to 
use those of the adults; when children start speaking, it is often the adults who 
are learning new words.
(‘Some children are so impatient that they coin their own demonstrative pronoun.  For 
instance, at the age of about 12 months, Max would point to different objects and 
say “doh?,” sometimes with the intent that we do something with the objects, such as 
bring them to him, and sometimes just wanting us to appreciate their existence’
(\citealp[p.\ 122]{Bloom:2000qz}; see further \citealp{Clark:1981bi,Clark:1982hj}).)
              </div>
              <div class="notes">And even where children have mastered a lexical convention, they will readily violate 
it in their own utterances in order to get a point across.
(‘From the time they first use words until they are about two or two-and-a-half, 
children noticeably and systematically overextend words.  For example, one child used 
the word “apple” to refer to balls of soap, a rubber-ball, a ball-lamp, a tomato, 
cherries, peaches, strawberries, an orange, a pear, an onion, and round biscuits’
\citep[p.\ 35]{Clark:1993bv}.)

          <p class="center">development as rediscovery</p>
          <div class="notes">The idea, in essence, is that cognitive development is a kind of rediscovery.
(But not exactly as Plato's myth had it.)
          </div>
          <div class="notes">How do humans get from core knowledge to knowledge knowledge?
I want to suggest that it involves a process of rediscovery.
I don't think it's a case of partial knowledge becoming gradually more complete, or of
the core knowledge providing content for later knowledge states.
Rather, I think the core knowledge shapes the  
subject's body, behaviour and attention in ways that facilitate discovery at the next stage.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">And, most importantly, core knowledge enables increasingly sophisticated forms of social 
interaction.
It is these social interactions---together with the bodily, behavioural and mental changes---that 
enable subsequent re-discoveries. 
So, on this view, the role of some early-developing abilities in explaining the later acquisition 
of conceptual understanding does not involve direct representational connections; 
rather the early developing abilities facilitate or enable social interaction, 
influence attention and inform behaviour; 
and these influences facilitate development.

          <div class="notes">To make this vague idea slightly more concrete, let me zoom in. 
I think having verbal labels for things sometimes helps with acquiring concepts of them.
Now this sounds paradoxical. 
Doesn't having a label for something mean being able to label correctly? 
And how could you label correctly without the corresponding concept? 
My suggestion is that having core knowledge is not having a concept (many disagree); 
but core knowledge could underpin your correct use of a label. 
Now labels are acquired through social interaction, or so I suggested earlier. 
Hence the picture.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Now this picture needs two qualifications. 
First, it's missing some details, and these details will vary from case to case 
(what's true of knowledge of objects might not be true of knowledge of number). 
Second, the picture might be completely wrong. 
But even if the picture is wrong, I'll bet that social interaction and core knowledge are both 
essential for explaining how humans come to know things. 
So I don't claim to know how these two are necessary, only that they are. 
In fact my aim isn't primarily to explain to you how these two factors explain the origins of 
mind. 
Instead my hope is this. 
I'll give you the background on social interaction and core knowledge. 
And you'll tell me how these two (or perhaps other factors) are involved in explaining how 
humans come to know things about objects, colours, actions, numbers and the rest.
