we looked at the notion of a core system, and of modularity.

I don't think any is fully satisfactory but I do think that the

cognition differ from those involved in having, acquiring and using knowledge.

          <div class="notes">It is a familiar idea,
from the history of science,
that there are multiple \textbf{theories} of the physical:
impetus and Newtonian mechancs, for example.
The impetus theory says that moving objects have something, impetus, that they gradually loose.
When they loose their impetus they stop moving.
If you push them you impart impetus to them, and that is why they move.
With Newtonian mechanics this is not the case; there is no impetus.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">In limited but common range of cases, impetus and Newtonian mechanics 
coincide.
However, the two theories make different predictions about the acceleration of falling objects,
and of a ascending objects (those launched vertically, in the manner of a rocket).
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Consider ascending objects.  We're fixing density and shape and considering how the size 
of objects changes things.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">According to Newtonian mechanics, if we ignore air resistance, then size makes no difference to
accelleration.  If we include air resistance, larger objects accellerate faster (because of the 
difference in ratio of mass to surface).
          </div>
          <div class="notes">By contrast, according to an impetus principle:
‘More massive objects accelerate at a slower rate. An object’s initial impetus continually 
dissipates because it is overcome by the effect of gravity. The more massive the ascending object, 
the more gravity counteracts its impetus.’ \citep[p.\ 445]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus}

‘A recent study by McCloskey and Kohl (Note 2) suggests that the straight-down belief is related to 
the impetus view of motion. In this study subjects completed several pencil-and-paper problems 
and then explained their answers. Subjects who evidenced the straight-down belief explained 
that when an object is pushed or thrown, it acquires force (i.e., impetus). However, they argued, 
an object that is passively carried by another moving object does not acquire force.’]

        <div data-what=".discriminate" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">Core knowledge enables one to distinguish things. For example it enables on to distinguish
those things which are blue from those which are not;
it enables one to distinguish those events which are causal interactions from those 
which are not;
it enables one to distinguish those sets which have two members from others;
and it enables one to distinguish different beliefs about the location of an object (say).
        </div>
        <div class="notes">(Here I'm using core knowledge in the broad, schematic sense to refer to representations
which are knowledge-like but not knowledge.)
        </div>
        <div data-what=".use-word" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">I conjecture that core knowledge faciliates acquisition of the correct use of a word,
perhaps very slowly.  The idea is that being able to discriminate things allows one to 
apply a label to them.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Importantly we can discriminate without having concepts.
If one thought that all discrimination involved concepts, this picture would become circular.
        </div>
        <div data-what=".because-experience" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">How does core knowledge enable one to correctly use words?
I think it modifies the overall phenomenal character of your experience,
typically by generating phenomenal expectations (which I called them perceptual expectations 
earlier in this version of the course).
Tuning in to the perceptual expectations can take a long time, which is why there may be 
a long interval between observing core knowledge and observing the correct use of words.
        </div>
        <div data-what=".acquire-concept" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">I also conjecture that using the word facilitates concept acquisition.
Many people would probably agree.
But how does it do this?
        </div>
        <div data-what=".because-reflection" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">My schematic suggestion is that using the word draws attention to all the things which are Xs.
The concept is acquired when you are struck by the question,
What do all these have in common?
        </div>
        <div class="notes">(Clearly this is not an account of how thinking gets started at all; the appeal
to reflection should make this obvious.)
        </div>
        <div class="notes">We have quite good evidence for this picture in the cases of colour and number,
and there is relevant evidence in the case of mindreading too.  (Also speech:
phonological awareness is linked to literacy and the particulars of the written
language learnt, so that alphabetic languages give a different profile --- alphabet is
roughly labelling phonemes.)
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The question we've been looking at last week is how children come to correctly
use words.

  <div class="notes">The key to answering this question (what is a model of action?) is to understand what a model
of action needs to achieve.
Part or all of what is needs to achieve is a specification of how purposive actions are related 
to their goals.
That is, the model has to answer this question:
What is the relation between an action and the outcome or outcomes to which it is directed?
  </div>
</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture05_04.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">One feature of actions is that, among all their actual and possible outcomes, some are goals to 
which they are directed.
I seize little Isabel by the wrists and swing her around, thereby  making her laugh and 
breaking a vase.
You might wonder what the goal of my action was.
Did I act in order to break the  vase or to make Isabel laugh?
Or was my action perhaps directed to some other goal, one that was not realised so that my 
action failed?
  </div>
  <div class="notes">A model of action has to specify the relation between actions and the 
goal or goals to which they are directed.
That is, it has to answer this question:
Among all of the actual and possible outcomes of an action, which are goals of the action?
  </div>
</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture05_05.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">The standard answer to this question involves intention.
An intention (1) represents an outcome, (2) causes an event; and (3) causes an event whose 
occurrence would normally lead to the outcome’s occurrence.
What singles out an actual or possible outcome as one to which the component actions are 
collectively directed?  It is the fact that this outcome is represented by the intention.
  </div>
</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture05_07.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">Note, by the way, that goals are not intentions.
Goals are actual or possible outcomes.
They are states of affairs.
Intentions, by contrast, are or involve mental states that represent a goal; they are a 
variety of goal-states.
It would be a terrible mistake to confuse a goal with a goal-state.
That would be like confusing a person with a photograph.
  </div>
</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture05_05.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">So, on one model of action,
the intention is what links an action to the outcomes to which it is directed.
Is this the model of action that infants' actually use?

        <p class="notes show">Does infants’ model involve intentions?</p>
        <div class="notes">Our question is, How do infants model actions?  
One possibility is that they use an adult commonsense model involving intentions.
According to this model, 
actions are events appropriately related to intentions 
and whether something is a goal of an action is determined by the contents of those intentions.

  <div class="notes">James desired to please his mother.</div>
  <div class="notes">James believed that going to church would please his mother.</div>
  <div class="notes">And this belief and desire caused his going to church.</div>

  <div class="notes">It appears, then, that we can explain the relation between an action and the goal or goals to which it is directed just in terms of belief and desire.</div>
  <div class="notes">We don't need to introduce intentions as further mental states.</div>
  <div class="notes">If we like we can say that an intention just is a suitable, action-causing belief-desire pair.</div>

understanding belief; on the contrary, even the simplest way of understanding intention
presupposes understanding belief (and desire).
So unless we think infants have a sophisticated understanding of mental states, we shouldn't 
suppose that their model of action includes intention.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">Reason (b) Minimal theory of mind ... presupposes an understanding of goal-directed action.
If we explain goal-directed action in terms of intention, we are thereby sneaking
beliefs and desire in through the back door.  So the whole minimal theory of mind project would
fail.
(You might say, on minimal theory of mind that instead of beliefs and desires we could combine 
registration and preference; but that would affect the construction since registration was 
explained in terms of goal-directed action).

of understanding this relation, perhaps one that doesn't involve insight into mental states.

  <div class="notes">Earlier I said that \dfGoalAscription{}
Given this definition, goal ascription involves three things:
\begin{enumerate}
\item representing an action
\item representing an outcome
\end{enumerate}
and
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item capturing the directedness of the action to the outcome.
\end{enumerate}
&nbsp;
  </div>
  <div class="notes">It is important to see that the third item---capturing directedness---is necessary.
This is quite simple but very important, so let me slowly explain why goal ascription requires 
representing the directedness of an action to an outcome.
Imagine two people, Ayesha and Beatrice, who each intend to break an egg.
Acting on her intention, Ayesha breaks her egg.
But Beatrice accidentally drops her egg while carrying it to the kitchen.

</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture06_020.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">So Ayesha and Beatrice perform visually similar actions which result in the same type of outcome, the breaking of an egg; 
but Beatrice's action is not directed to the outcome of her action whereas Ayesha's is.

<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture06_021.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">Goal ascription requires the ability to distinguish between Ayesha's action and Beatrice's 
action. 
This requires representing not only actions and outcomes but also the directedness of actions 
to outcomes.

How could we tell whether an action happens \emph{because} it brought about a particular 
outcome in the past? 
This might be done with insects.
But it can's so easily be done with primates, who have a much broader repertoire of actions
and wider range of motivations.

The problem is that we primates can perform old actions in order to achieve novel goals.
In such cases there will be a mismatch between the goals of our actions and their teleological

Maybe we should allow that this idea will sometimes enable goal ascription to succeed,
but it will probably not allow for a very wide range of goals to be correctly ascribed.

        <div class="notes">What do we mean by `better means'?
Problem with defining $R$ in terms of rationality is requirement of core knowledge / modularity.
So what about efficiency instead of rationality?
One problem with defining $R$ in terms of minimising energy is that in 
acting we often face a trade off between how much energy to put into an action and how likely 
the action is to result in success.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Suppose I can save some energy by throwing the cup at the sink instead of walking over and 
carefully placing it in the sink,
and suppose that I choose to walk over and place the cup in the sink.
In this situation the principle of efficiency fails to identify $G$, placing the cup in the 
sink, as the goal of my action.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">One way to address this problem might be to think of efficiency in terms of achieving a good trade-off between several factors:
not just energy but also the probability that a particular action will in fact result in the goal being achieved.
This is the idea I am trying to get at here ...
        </div>
        <div class="notes">An action of type $a'$ is a better means of realising outcome $G$ in a given situation than an action of type $a$ if, for instance, actions of type $a'$ normally involve less effort than actions of type $a$ </div>

        <div class="notes">A problem with what we have so far is side-effects, which can be highly reliable.</div>
        <div class="notes">Actions typically have side-effects which are not goals.  For example,</div>
        <div class="notes">suppose that I walk over here with the goal of being next to you.</div>
        <div class="notes">This action has lots of side-effects: </div>
        <div class="notes">\begin{itemize}</div>

How good is the agent at optimising the rationality, or the efficiency, of her actions?
And how good is the observer at identifying the optimality of actions in relation to outcomes?
\textbf{
For the relation to be readily detectible, we want there to be a match between
(i) how well the agent can optimise her actions
and
(i) how well the observer can detect optimality.}
Failing such a match, the relation R will either not be detectible or not be reliable.

To describe how they identify goals (that is, distinguish among the actual and possible 
outcomes of an action which its goals are) 
is not yet quite to have explained how they model actions.
Fortunately not much more is needed ...

I don't have a suggestion about how the transition might be made.
I think that experience probably plays a role analogous to it plays in knowledge of colour.
But there's something else.
I want to suggest we can use these discoveries about action to fill out our understanding 
of communication, and of cooperative interactions.
