Being highly cooperative enables them to communicate, linguistically and non-linguistically.

Of course the challenge is to get from the story to the details.</div>

        <div class="notes">In this experiment, we contrast failed reaches with pointing ...</div>
        <div class="notes">Hare and Call (\citeyear{hare_chimpanzees_2004}) contrast pointing with a failed reach as two ways of indicating which of two closed containers a reward is in.  Chimps can easily interpret a failed reach but are stumped by the point to a closed container.</div>
        <div class="notes">You are the subjects.  This is what you saw (two conditions).  Your task was to choose the container with the reward.</div>
        <div class="notes">Infants can do this sort of task, it's really easy for them \citep{Behne:2005qh}.  (And, incidentally, they distinguish communicative points from similar but non-communicative bodily configurations.)</div>
        <div class="notes">The pictures in the figure stand for what participants, who were chimpanzees, saw.</div>
        <div class="notes">The question was whether participants would be able to work out which of two containers concealed a reward.</div>
        <div class="notes">In the condition depicted in the left panel, participants saw a chimpanzee trying but failing to reach for the correct container. </div>
        <div class="notes">Participants had no problem getting the reward in this case, suggesting that they understood the goal of the failed reach.</div>
        <div class="notes">In the condition depicted in the right panel, a human pointed at the correct container.</div>
        <div class="notes">Participants did not get the reward in this case as often as in the failed reach case, suggesting that they failed to understand the goal of the pointing action.</div>
        <div class="notes">(Actually the apes were above chance in using the point, just better in the failed reach condition.  Hare et al comment ;chimpanzees can learn to exploit a pointing cue with some experience, as established by previous research (Povinelli et al. 1997; Call et al. 1998, 2000), and so by the time they engaged in this condition they had learned to use arm extension as a discriminative cue to the food’s location' \citep[p.\ 578]{hare_chimpanzees_2004}.)</div>
        <div class="notes">
          \footnote{
          The contrast between the two conditions is not due merely to the fact that one involves a human and the other a chimpanzee. 
          Participants were also successful when the failed reach was executed by a human rather than another chimpanzee \citep[][experiment 1]{hare_chimpanzees_2004}.

        <div class="handout">‘the most fundamental aspects of language that make it such a uniquely powerful form of human cognition and communication---joint attention, reference via perspectives, reference to absent entities, cooperative motives to help and to share, and other embodiments of shared intentionality---are already present in the humble act of infant pointing.’ \citep[p.\ 719]{Tomasello:2007fi}</div>
        <div class="handout">‘cooperative communication does not depend on language, […] language depends on it.’ \citep[p.\ 720]{Tomasello:2007fi}</div>
        <div class="handout">‘Pointing may […] represent a key transition, both phylogenetically and ontogenetically, from nonlinguistic to linguistic forms of human communication.’ \citep[p.\ 720]{Tomasello:2007fi}</div>
