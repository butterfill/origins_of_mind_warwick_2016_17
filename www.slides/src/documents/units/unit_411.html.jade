  Many behaviours exhibited by infants, including anticipatory looking, looking

  One-year-old children predict actions of agents with false beliefs about the
  locations of objects \citep{Clements:1994cw,Onishi:2005hm,Southgate:2007js},
  and about the contents of containers \citep{he:2011_false}, taking into
  account verbal communication \citep{Song:2008qo,scott:2012_verbal_fb}.
  They
  will also choose ways of helping \citep[]{Buttelmann:2009gy} and
  communicating \citep{Knudsen:2011fk,southgate:2010fb} with others depending on
  whether their beliefs are true or false. And in much the way that irrelevant
  facts about the contents of others’ beliefs modulate adult subjects’ response
  times, such facts also affect how long 7-month-old infants look at some
  stimuli \citep[]{kovacs_social_2010}.

  .notes These experimenters added an anticipation prompt and measured to which box subjects looked first \citep{Clements:1994cw}.

    What got me hooked philosophical psychology, 
    and on philosophical issues in the development of mindreading in particular 
    was a brilliant finding by Wendy Clements who was Josef Perner's phd student.

  .notes These findings were carefully confirmed \citep{Clements:2000nc,Garnham:2001ql,Ruffman:2001ng}. 
  .notes Around 2000 there were a variety of findings pointing in the direction of a confict between different measures. 
  .notes These included studies on word learning \citep{Carpenter:2002gc,Happe:2002sr} and false denials \citep{Polak:1999xr}.
