As we will see, how we first come to know things about colours, say, isn't quite the same

But there is one very general point we can make: in all these domains, we will face 
Davidson's challenge, the challenge of explaining what is inbetween mindless behaviour

        <div class="notes">A famous study by Renee Baillargeon and her collaborators provides evidence that humans can 
represent unperceived objects from around four months of age or earlier.  
This is called the 'drawbridge study'
        </div>
        <div class="notes">What you are about to see are the test events from Experiment 1 of Baillargeon et al's 
1987 study.  You're looking at them from the side whereas the subjects, four-month olds,
were looking at them from the front (which is to your right).
        </div>
        <div class="notes">In showing you these test events,
I need to explain the method used in this experiment, \emph{habituation}; 
this is a method we will encounter repeatedly so it's good to understand how it is 
supposed to work.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">%glossary: habituation</div>
        <div class="notes">What you see here is a barrier rotating through 180 degrees.
Infants were habituated to this; that is, they were shown it repeatedly until it no longer 
held their interest.
The first time they're shown this, they might spend 60 seconds looking at it, which is a long
time for an infant; but after, say, five demonstrations, they'd only be looking at it for 
around 10 seconds.  That is, they are habituated to this display.

        <div class="notes">Now there is a very small change to the display.
The display is just as before, except for before the drawbridge moves an object is placed 
behind it.
There are then two different things that could happen.  One is that the drawbridge moves 
exactly as before, rotating a full 180 degrees.  This is called the 'impossible event'.
The other is that the drawbridge now rotates for 120 degrees, which is the 'possible event'.
In no case is the object visible after the drawbridge has started moving.
We want to know which events infants find more novel.
If they are unable to know facts about  the locations of unperceived objects, then they should 
find the
'possible event' more novel than the 'impossible event' because it is more different
from the event they have been habituated to.
On the other hand, if infants are able know facts about the locations of unperceived objects,
they should find the impossible event more novel than the possible event because, well,
it's impossible.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">To find out what infants find more interesting, they are divided into two groups.  
One group sees the impossible event, the other the possible event.
The experimenters measure how long the infants look at these events, which is the measure of 
their dishabituation.  The background assumptions are that looking longer indicates more 
interest, and that interest is driven by novelty.

Here you can see their appratus, which is quite similar to what \citet{baillargeon:1987_object} 
used.
They had a screen that infants could pull forwards to get to an object that was sometimes
hidden behind it.
They made two comparisons.
First, were infants more likely to pull the screen forwards when an object was placed behind it?
Second, were how did infants' performance compare when the barrier was not opaque but transparent?

object was present than when it was absent.
Since infants wanted the toy, if they knew it was behind the barrier they should have pulled
forward the barrier more often when the toy was behind it.
This is exactly what they did when the barrier was transparent.
But look what happens when the barrier is opaque, so that the toy is not visible to infants 
when they have to prepare the pulling action: they no longer pull the barrier more often
when the toy was behind it.

And this is not isolated evidence; for example, \citet{moore:2008_factors} use a different

          <div class="notes">You might be wondering whether there's a philosophical problem here.
Science is a messy business and you get conflicting results all the time.
But this particular pattern of conflicting results is extremely interesting philosophically.
It shows that we cannot say that, at, say, five months of age, infants know facts about the 
locations
of particular unperceived objects.  
We cannot say this because doing so generates predictions which are clearly false (predictions
about where they will search for an unperceived object).
But it also shows that we cannot say that they have no sense at all concerning facts about the 
locations of particular unperceived objects.  We cannot say this because of the
competence they manifest in distinguishing possible from impossible events.

something inbetween knowledge and its absence, something that is like knowledge in some 
respects but falls short of it in others.

          <div class="notes">I think we should be cautious about the inference from separable systems to kinds of knowledge.  
(Think about modularity.)
It should be an open question for us whether what underpins infants' abilities to distinguish
possible from impossible events is really a kind knowledge or something else.
(This is a question we'll explore in some detail later.)
          </div>
          <div class="notes">I mention this quote just to show you that we have a problem which is partly philosophical
and partly scientific.  
The scientific part involves identifying distinct systems of representation and understanding
their development.
The philosophical part is to make sense of the idea that there can
be different kinds of knowledge, or things that are like knowledge but not knowledge, and
to explore how different kinds of knowledge are related.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">[*aside: move]
At this point you might object.  The question is about knowledge.  
But does either searching or distinguishing really provide evidence of knowing?
You might insist that neithermanifest knowledge in infants.
It is a good question whether searching or distinguishing manifests knowledge.
For now I just want to note that if you think neither is, then Davidson's challenge becomes 
even more pressing -- more pressing because we now need two distinct kinds of state which
are like knowledge in some respects but not in others, not just one!
It's perhaps also worth mentioning that whether or not the things manifested in searching and 
distinguishing are knowledge proper, they are surely things that matter for explaining how 
knowledge is eventually acquired.

          <div class="notes">To sum up so far, the question for this course is, How do humans first come to know  about--and
to knowingly manipulate--objects, causes, words, numbers, colours, actions and minds?
I've been suggesting we can't answer it simply by appealing to nativism, empiricism or other 
grand myths.
Instead we need to focus on the particular mechanisms that are involved in different cases.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">But then you might wonder, What philosophical questions arise here?  Isn't this a narrowly
pscyhological--and therefore scientific--issue?
The answer is no because thinking about how humans come to know things requires us to meet 
Davidson's challenge, to understand things that are neither mindless nor thought or knowledge 
but somewhere in between.
As Hood suggests in the quote I just showed you, this might involve rethinking what knowledge 
is.

          <div class="notes">I hope I've given you a flavour of the approach we're going to take.
Good philosophy of mind has always been driven by scientific findings about the mind.
John Locke, David Hume as well as more recent philosophers like Jerry Fodor and Andy Clark all 
start with a deep understanding of the science of the mind.
But there is a difference.
Fodor and many other contemporary philosophers are working on the big picture, trying to make 
explicit general features of the conceptual framework which scientists have more or less 
implicitly adopted.
They are also often intrested in questions about the foundations of psychology itself.
By contrast, what I want us to do in this course is to look at specific problems that arise 
from the evidence,
and to provide philosophical tools for tackling this problem.
So you might say that whereas others are trying to be the architect, we're trying more 
modestly to build the tools.
This might sound too modest to be interesting.
You'd probably prefer to be the architect whose plans guide the scientists rather than the 
underlabourer who makes tools for them; who wouldn't?
But, as we'll see, it turns out that attention to the details will give us new perspectives on 
some key philosophical issues about the nature of knowledge, perception and action.

          <div class="notes">We're going to try to understand how humans come to know about things by examining what 
developmental psychology tells us about the acquisition of knowledge.
This turns out to be a partly philosophical project because understanding the apparently 
conflicting evidence requires us to re-think notions like knowledge and representation.
In practice, this means looking carefully, and in detail, at the scientific evidence.
If you want to know how minds work, you have to start with the evidence.
