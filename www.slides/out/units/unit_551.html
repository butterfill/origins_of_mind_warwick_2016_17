  .notes We can deepen this criticism of the mapping idea with an exercursion into philosophy of language.
  .notes Recall this quesiton, which we asked earlier.
  p.notes.show What do I know or understand when I can communicate with language?
  .notes I take it that proponents of mapping think the answer is a word-concept mapping, where the concept is the meaning of the word.
  .notes But here we should step back and ask how this knowledge is supposed to explain
  .notes The key is to start with a mildly sceptical attitude towards notions like meaning and concept.
  .notes They should only be introduced if we can say clearly why they are necessary.
  .notes On one way of thinking about what word meanings are for, they are necessary only to explain systematicity and productivity.

  p.center objection
  .notes I've focussed on “puttaputta” because it illustrates how even children with normal experiences of language sometimes coin their own words as soon as they start using words.
  .notes You might object that “puttaputta” is a very primitive use of language, somewhere between a word and a sentence.
  .notes But children also coin proper words such as “fire-dog” for a stray dog found near a fire (Clark 1998: 14) and “darking” for the action of colouring.
  .notes Here's an example:
+slide
  .notes This exeample shows Shem inventing the word “smashit.”  This is a nice complex example involving a noun probably derived from a verb (to smash) where Shem simultaneously explains what the word means and refines its pronunciation:
  .notes Shem is age 2;3.21
  p CINDY:	yeah … an(d) who's this?
  p SHEM:	s ma uh  uh at uh uh uh ma farmer farmingk [: farming] an(d) (h)as (s)maz(ik) uh where the key an uh go home the hose.
  p CINDY:	he carries uh what?
  p SHEM:	is um uh farmers (s)mazik an(d) a hose an own uh get in uh home … the hose.
  p ['smazik' or 'smashit' refers to an axe] 
  p CINDY:	right … he carries a hose and what else?
  p SHEM:	uh smashit
  p CINDY:	a smasher?
  p CINDY:	this thing?
  p SHEM:	yeah.
  p CINDY:	yeah … he needs a smasher so he can smash through doors to get to the fire if he has to … and he takes those home with him?
  p SHEM:	yeah.
  p CINDY:	what does he do with the smasher at home?
  p SHEM:	uh uh uh uh an(d) smash de the window an(d) water in the window.

  <div class="notes">I've been considering the mapping idea, the idea that children have to establish a correspondence between words and concepts.</div>
  <div class="notes">I agree that this the right way to think about some language learning; in particular, learning colour words like 'red' is well modelled in this way.</div>
  <div class="notes">But I've offered two qualifications.</div>
  <div class="notes">First, in at least some of these cases it may be that the concept comes after the word.</div>
  <div class="notes">Second, while it's appropriate to think of abilities to use language as requiring word-concept mappings in some cases, like the case of 'red',</div>
  <div class="notes">I used the example of 'puttaputta' to suggest that there are at least some cases of communiation with words which don't seem to involve learning or inventing word-concept mappings.</div>
  <div class="notes">I'm not claiming to have shown that the mapping idea is wrong.</div>
  <div class="notes">I merely want to offer you an open challenge: can we make sense of the mapping idea and do we need it?</div>

  <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
  <div class="notes">Note that the mapping idea depends on a philosophical claim about what it is to know the meaning of a word.</div>
  <div class="notes">This is something we should question, I think.  (But not now.)</div>
