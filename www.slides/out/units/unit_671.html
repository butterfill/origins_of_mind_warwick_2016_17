    <title>What is a communicative action? | Origins of Mind</title>
    <meta name="description" content="To understand what follows from infants' abilities to comprehend and produce pointing gestures, we need to ask what a communicative action is.  One view hinges on shared intentionality, which is related to Grice's attempts to analyse meaning.  Here we consider implications of that view and contrast it with two alternatives."/>

        <div class="notes">Let’s start with some simple examples of non-communicative actions.  </div>
        <ol>
          <li>Ayesha hits Ben intending to bruise him.</li>
          <div class="notes">Purely physical interaction.</div>
          <li class="hide">Ayesha fakes a yawn intending to cause Ben to yawn.  </li>
          <li class="hide">Ayesha lays a trail of false footprints intended to deceive Ben.</li>
          <li class="hide">Ayesha waves at Ben with the intention that he will recognise that she intends him to come over.</li>
        </ol>
        <div data-what="li:eq(0)" data-class="blur-text" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div>
        <div data-what="li:eq(1)" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">Why are these actions non-communicative?  Ayesha intends her fake yawn to have an effect on Ben, but the effect is a physiological one.  The response she wants from him is mechanical.</div>
        <div class="notes">But there are also non-communicative actions which require a rational response from the people they’re directed at.  For example:</div>
        <div data-what="li:eq(1)" data-class="blur-text" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div>
        <div data-what="li:eq(2)" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">Note here that although Ayesha intends to provide Ben with misinformation, her action isn’t communicative.</div>
        <div class="notes">Intuitively, there’s a difference between deliberately providing information or misinformation to someone and communicating with her (Grice 1989: 218).  </div>
        <div class="notes">So what makes an action communicative?</div>
        <div class="notes">Paul Grice has a neat answer to this question.</div>
        <div class="notes">He notes that we sometimes achieve things merely by letting other people know that we intend to achieve them.</div>
        <div class="notes">Waving is one of the simplest examples:</div>
        <div data-what="li:eq(2)" data-class="blur-text" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div>
        <div data-what="li:eq(3)" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">In this example, Ayesha’s goal is to get Ben to come over.  Her means of achieving this is to get Ben to recognise that this is what she intends.  So when she waves, her intention is that waving will let Ben know that she intends him to come over.</div>
        <div class="slide em-above">
          <p>Goal: get Ben to come over</p>
          <p>Means: get Ben to recognise that I intend to get Ben to come over</p>
          <p><span class="intention">Intention</span><span>: to get Ben to come over by means of getting Ben to recognise that I </span><span class="intention">intend</span><span> to get Ben to come over.</span></p>
          <div class="notes">You can achieve some things just by letting people know that you intend to achieve them.  To achieve things in this way is to perform an act of communication.</div>

          If we suppose that children who can point have an understanding of communication as Grice understands it,

           They don't seem able to knowledgably identify causal interactions among unseen physical objects.  Can we really be confident that it's easier for them to think knowledgably about intereactions involving mental states?  (Maybe it is; we just don't have evidence, I think.)

          <div class="notes">Why does this distinction matter?</div>
          <div class="notes">Grice’s explicates meaning and communication in terms of ulterior intentions.</div>
          <div class="notes">His project is to give a reductive analysis of these notions, meaning and communication.</div>
          <div class="notes">Ulterior intentions are precisely what is needed for such an analysis of meaning.</div>
          <div class="notes">This is because ulterior intentions ‘do not involve language, in the sense that their description does not have to mention language’ or any semantic concepts like meaning \citep[p.\ 298]{Davidson:1992pl}.</div>
          <div class="notes">But, Davidson points out, we don’t have to attempt an analysis of meaning and communication.</div>
          <div class="notes">After all, Grice’s analysis has been subject to plenty of counterexamples and objections \citep{Schiffer:1987zb}.</div>
          <div class="notes">(Davidson objects that ‘it is not clear that these principles [Grice’s] are designed to handle the gamut of examples we find in literature’ \citep[p.\ 300]{Davidson:1992pl}.</div>
          <div class="notes">\citet{Davidson:1991ic} discusses one literary example at length.  He argues that ‘Joyce takes us back to the foundations and origins of communication; he puts us in the situation of the jungle linguist trying to get the hand of a new language and a novel culture, to assume the perspective of someone who is an alien or an exile’ \citep[p.\ 11]{Davidson:1991ic}.)</div>

          <div class="notes">This aim ‘assumes the notion of meaning’, but it is important because ‘it provides a purpose which any speaker must have in speaking, and thus constitutes a norm against which speakers and others can measure the success of their verbal behavior.’ \citep[p.\ 11]{Davidson:1994ol}</div>
