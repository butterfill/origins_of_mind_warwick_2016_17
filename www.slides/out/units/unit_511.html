          <div class="notes">The answer is that we figure out the meanings of words in just the way we figure other things out, like why Ayesha is so glum or who ate my breakfast.</div>
          <div class="notes">But now recall Davidson's claim that If someone can think, she can communicate by language.</div>
          <div class="notes">I take it that Davidson's claim is incompatible with the view that language acquisition involves forming hypotheses about the meanings of words at the outset.</div>
          <div class="notes">Be careful about the incompatibility: it's not that forming hypotheses about the meanings of words can't be part of the process, at a later stage.</div>
          <div class="notes">The problem is that this---forming hypotheses---can't happen before at least some linguistic competence is present.</div>
