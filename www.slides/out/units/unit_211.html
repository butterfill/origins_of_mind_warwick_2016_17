          <div class="notes">The problem is quite general.
It doesn't arise only in the case of knowledge of objects but also in other domains 
(like knowledge of number and knowledge of mind).
And it doesn't arise only from evidence about infants or nonhuman primates; it would also 
arise if our focus were exclusively on human adults.
More on this later.
For now, our aim is to better understand the problem as it arises in the case of knowledge of objects.

The term is used in a wide variety of ways.
As I use it, representation is just a generic term covering knowledge, belief and much else besides.
