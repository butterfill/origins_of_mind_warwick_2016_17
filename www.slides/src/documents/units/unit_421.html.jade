+slide_theChallenge
  .notes So how does this second puzzle bear on our overall objective?
  .notes The challenge is to explain the emergence, in evolution or development, of mindreading.
  .notes The fact that mindreading is sometimes automatic and sometimes not is good evidence that mindreading is not a single thing.
  .notes Rather there are multiple kinds of process or system involved in mindreading.
  .notes From this we can conclude two things.
  .notes First, in this respect, the cases of mindreading is much like the cases of colour and physical objects.
  .notes These also involved multiple systems; this took the form of a distinction between core knowledge and knowledge proper.
  .notes Second, we have further grounds for thinking that some forms of mindreading are modular.

  .notes [These slides are from a joint presentation with Ian Apperly (BCCCD)]
  .notes What is the relation between infant and adult capacities for mindreading?
  .notes It's important at this point to recognise that there are two quite different possibilties.
