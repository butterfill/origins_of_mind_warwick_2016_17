            Language is ‘a rational activity on the part of creatures to whom can be ascribed intention and purpose’.

        <ol>
          <li>Communicating with language involves being able to understand what you've said.</li>
          <li>Being trained in how words are used does not enable one to understand what would be said in uttering those words.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="em-above">Conclusion:</p>
        <p>We cannot fully explain how humans become able to communicate with language by appeal to training.</p>
        <div class="notes">Note that this is a point about suffiency.  It's not an objection, but it is a lacuna.</div>
        <div class="notes">And it's a lacuna that's hard to fill</div>
        <div class="notes">It seems like, on this view, there has to be a magic moment when all that training somehow turns into the expression of thought.</div>
        <div class="notes">Let me put this another way.</div>
        <div class="notes">On this view, there is a gap between rat-like abilities to use words and thoughtful expression.</div>
        <div class="notes">And no good account of how the gap could be crossed.</div>
