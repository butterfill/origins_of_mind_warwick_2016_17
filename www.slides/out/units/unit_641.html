            Human adults have extensive knowledge of the syntax of their languages,  
            as illustrated by, for example, their abilities to detect grammatical and ungramatical sentences which they have never heard before, independently of their meanings.

          <div class="notes">We need to task two questions.</div>
          <p class="center"><span class="hide step2 core">core   </span><span class="knowledge">knowledge</span><span> of </span><span class="syntax">syntax</span><span> </span><span class="hide step3">is innate (?) </span></p>
          <div data-what=" .syntax" data-class="bkg-words-highlight-invert" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
          <div class="notes">First, what is this thing, syntax, which is known?</div>
          <div class="notes">This thing they know, the syntax, isn't plausibly just a list of which sentences are grammatical.</div>
          <div class="notes">Because people can make judgements about arbitrarily long, entirely novel sentences.</div>
          <div class="notes">Rather, the thing known must be something that enables people to make judgements about sentences.</div>
          <div class="notes">We might think of it roughly as a theory of syntax.</div>
          <div class="notes">It's like a theory in this sense: knowledge of it enables you to make judgements about the grammaticality of arbitrary sentences.</div>
          <div data-what=" .syntax" data-class="bkg-words-highlight-invert" class="slide anim-continue anim-removeclass"></div>
          <div data-what=" .knowledge" data-class="bkg-words-highlight-invert" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
          <div class="notes">The second question is, Is it *knowledge* we have syntax or something else?</div>
          <div class="notes">There's something interesting.</div>
          <div class="notes">The knowledge can be revealed indirectly, by asking people about whether particular sentences are grammatical.</div>
          <div class="notes">But people can't say anything about how they know the sentence is grammatical.</div>
          <div class="notes">It's like perceiving the shape of something: there isn't much to say about how you know.</div>
          <div class="notes">So the theory of syntax isn't something we can discover by introspection:</div>
          <div class="notes">we have to *rediscover* it from scratch by investigating people's linguistic abilities.</div>
          <div data-what=".step2" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-continue anim-removeclass"></div>
          <div data-what=" .core" data-class="bkg-words-highlight-invert" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
          <div class="notes">Knowledge of syntax therefore seems to have some of the features associated with core knowledge.</div>
          <div class="notes">First, it is domain-specific.</div>
          <div class="notes">Second, it is inaccessible.  That is, it can't guide arbitrary actions.</div>
          <div class="notes">In what follows I want to suggest that syntax provides a paradigm case for thinking about core knowledge.</div>
          <div data-what=" .core, .knowledge" data-class="bkg-words-highlight-invert" class="slide anim-continue anim-removeclass"></div>

          <div data-what=".step3" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
          <div class="notes">In addition, I want to use the case of syntax for thinking about the question, What is innate in humans?</div>
          <div class="notes">I was astonished how many people considered this question in the unassessed essay, some people seem really fascinated by it.</div>
          <div class="notes">But almost no one discussed the case of syntax in depth.  If you're going to talk about innateness, you really need to know a little bit about syntax.</div>
          <div class="notes">So I'm also going to provide you with that understanding.</div>

            <div data-what=".step2" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
            <div class="notes">So the key question was whether infants would look more at the yellow bottle (which is familiar) or the blue bottle (which is novel).</div>
            <div class="notes">If they think 'one' refers to 'bottle', we'd expect them to look longer at the blue bottle;</div>
            <div class="notes">and conversely if they think one refers to 'yellow bottle', then they're being asked whether they see another yellow bottle.</div>
            <div data-what=".control" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>

          <p class="center">From 18 months of  age or earlier, infants represent the syntax of noun phrases in much the way adults do.</p>
          <div class="notes">So there is core knowledge of syntax ... or is there?</div>
          <div class="slide">
            <div class="notes">Core knowledge is often characterised as innate.</div>
            <div class="notes">I think this is a mistake (more about this later), but many of you do not.</div>
            <p class="center em-above">But are these representations <span class="innate">innate</span><span>?</span></p>

            <div class="notes">What do we mean by innate here?</div>
            <div class="notes">The easy answer is: not learned.</div>
            <div class="notes">But I think there's a more interesting way to approach understanding what 'innate' means.</div>
            <div class="notes">Quite a few people pointed out that there isn't agreement on what innateness is.</div>
            <div class="notes">But this is not very interesting by itself because there's disagreement about most things and potential causes of disagreement include ignorance and stupidity.</div>
            <div class="notes">It's also important that the mere fact that a single term is used with multiple meanings isn't an objection to anyone.</div>
            <div class="notes">As philosophers, some of you are tempted to catalogue different possible notions of innateness.</div>
            <div class="notes">I encourage you to resist this temptation; if you want to collect something, pick something useful like banknotes.</div>
            <div class="notes">There's a much better way to approach things.</div>
            <div class="notes">Let's see what kind of findings are, or would be, taken to show that something is innate.</div>
            <div class="notes">We can use these to constrain our thinking about innateness.</div>

        <div class="notes">So attributes like being genetically specified are extraneous---they may be typical features of innate things, but they aren't central to the notion.</div>

        <div class="notes">Here are two reasons why I think we shouldn't worry too much about innateness in trying to understand the origins of mind.  </div>
        <div class="notes">(1) The question about innateness concerns the first transition, whereas I think the second should be our focus (for pragmatic reasons: there's more research).</div>
        <div class="notes">
          (2) Discoveries about innately-primed learning make only a relatively modest contribution to understanding the emergence of core knowledge in development. 
          So even when we consider the first transition, it's not obvious that discoveries about innateness are very illuminating, for all their pop-science appeal.

        <div class="notes">But knowing where the eggs came from is unlikely to be critical to understanding how the cake was manufactured.</div>

        <p>Conclusion</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Adults have inaccessible, domain-specific representations concerning the syntax of natural languages.</li>
          <li>So do infants (from 18 months of age or earlier, well before they can use the syntax in production).</li>
          <li><span>These representations plausibly enable understanding and play a key role in the development of abilities to communicate with language.</span></li>
          <li>These representations are a paradigm case of core knowledge.</li>
          <div data-what=" li:eq(2) span" data-class="bkg-words-highlight-limegreen" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div>
          <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
          <div class="notes">This paradigm allows me to highlight something about core knowledge.</div>
          <div class="notes">I would be a mistake to suppose that there is some core knowledge which later becomes knowledge proper --- e.g. the fact that barriers stop solid objects is first core knowledge then later knowledge.</div>
          <div class="notes">The content of the core knowledge is a theory of syntax (let's say).</div>
          <div class="notes">Or, in another case, the content of core knowledge is some principles of object perception.</div>
          <div class="notes">These are things that human adults do not typically know at all, at least not in the sense that they could state the principles.</div>
          <div class="notes">So core knowledge enables us to do things, like anticipate where unseen objects will re-appear or communicate with words.</div>
          <div class="notes">It doesn't seem to be linked directly to the acquisition of concepts.</div>
