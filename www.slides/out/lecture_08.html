        <div class="notes">Having core knowledge of something does not involve having any knowledge knowledge at all.
Here I'm going to use the term ‘concept of X’ for that which enables one to have knowledge 
of Xs.
How do we get from core knowledge to concepts?
        </div>
        <div data-what=".discriminate" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">Core knowledge enables one to distinguish things. For example it enables on to distinguish
those things which are blue from those which are not;
it enables one to distinguish those events which are causal interactions from those 
which are not;
it enables one to distinguish those sets which have two members from others;
and it enables one to distinguish different beliefs about the location of an object (say).
        </div>
        <div class="notes">(Here I'm using core knowledge in the broad, schematic sense to refer to representations
which are knowledge-like but not knowledge.)
        </div>
        <div data-what=".use-word" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">I conjecture that core knowledge faciliates acquisition of the correct use of a word,
perhaps very slowly.  The idea is that being able to discriminate things allows one to 
apply a label to them.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Importantly we can discriminate without having concepts.
If one thought that all discrimination involved concepts, this picture would become circular.
        </div>
        <div data-what=".because-experience" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">How does core knowledge enable one to correctly use words?
I think it modifies the overall phenomenal character of your experience,
typically by generating phenomenal expectations (which I called them perceptual expectations 
earlier in this version of the course).
Tuning in to the perceptual expectations can take a long time, which is why there may be 
a long interval between observing core knowledge and observing the correct use of words.
        </div>
        <div data-what=".acquire-concept" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">I also conjecture that using the word facilitates concept acquisition.
Many people would probably agree.
But how does it do this?
        </div>
        <div data-what=".because-reflection" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">My schematic suggestion is that using the word draws attention to all the things which are Xs.
The concept is acquired when you are struck by the question,
What do all these have in common?
        </div>
        <div class="notes">(Clearly this is not an account of how thinking gets started at all; the appeal
to reflection should make this obvious.)
        </div>
        <div class="notes">We have quite good evidence for this picture in the cases of colour and number,
and there is relevant evidence in the case of mindreading too.  (Also speech:
phonological awareness is linked to literacy and the particulars of the written
language learnt, so that alphabetic languages give a different profile --- alphabet is
roughly labelling phonemes.)
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The question we've been looking at last week is how children come to correctly
use words.

          <div class="notes">Shipwreck survivor faces less pressing objections but doesn't suit us because requires

          <p class="center">social interaction</p>
          <div class="notes">So far we've considered two pictures of how children learn to communicate with words: training and 
reasoning to word-concept mappings.
Both pictures miss social interaction.
On one picture the infant is an outsider who might as well be observing those around her through a 
telescope.
On the other picture the child is a blank to be shaped by those around her.
There is no meaningful interaction between the infant and adults around her; or, if there is, it 
makes no difference to her development.
But could there be a role for social interaction in learning the meanings of words?
If you think about the examples of creativity --- homesigns and puttaputta --- this seems plausible.
Communication with words happens in the context of joint action, and it is a tool for joint action.

          <div class="notes">It's standard to suppose that creativity is a side-issue and that learning from those around 
us is the norm.
This view is encouraged by the idea that language is fundamentally a system of conventions, 
and that coming to communicate with words is a matter of getting into those conventions.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Acquiring the ability to communicate with words is an essentially creative process.
Conventions in the surrounding culture can be useful, but they are no more than useful accessories.

also challenges both lab rat view, and some versions of the shipwreck survivor view.
In both cases, the assumption is that infants acquiring words are learning to conform
to conventions or regularities of some kind.  But they are not.
(This point is not challenge for Bloom's view, as his emphasis on mindreading allows that
infants might be detecting what words mean on particular occasions.)

My proposal is that we have to take two factors into account.  One is core knowledge, the 
other is social interaction.
Our current project is to understand where abilities to communicate fit into this 
picture---to understand, that is, what role they might play in explaining how humans 
come to know things.

Because it implies two things:
First, it implies that infants' pointing is referential communication; that is, 
communication about an object.
(Contrast sharing a smile; we're communicating, but not necessarily referring.)
Second, it implies that infants have some understanding of joint engagement.

  <div class="notes">Why is this significant?
Because it implies that infant pointing is not just a matter of getting you to do
things for the infant, nor of getting you to do things with the infant.
Instead it can be used where the infant has no expectation that you will do anything
with or for the infant.
And this matters because it constrains how an infant could understand pointing.

          <p class="center">Hypothesis 1: Pure use (compare block & slab).</p>
          <div class="notes">The fact that infants can point to request, inform and initiate joint attention
shows that the simple block & slab model is wrong because that is a model 
where communicative actions have a fixed purpose, and pointing does not.
It seems to rule out the block & slab model.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Recall that there were two limits on block & slab: (a) fixed purpose and (b) fixed
context.  We've seen that (a) pointing does not have a fixed purpose.
What about fixed context?
A further finding bears on this ...

Suppose that we are doing puzzle.  Then if I point to a piece, I probably intend you to do 
something with it in the context of our activity.
By contrast, if we are tidying up, a point to the same object might mean something different.

‘In this study, in each of two conditions infants shared a clean-up game involving multiple 
different objects with an experimenter (E1). At the end of this game, depending on the condition, 
either E1 or a different experimenter (E2), with whom infants had not shared any relevant 
experience, pointed toward a new object. If infants understood the situation correctly, 
they should clean up this new object when E1 pointed but not when E2 pointed.’

        <div class="notes">Let’s start with some simple examples of non-communicative actions.  </div>
        <ol>
          <li>Ayesha hits Ben intending to bruise him.</li>
          <div class="notes">Purely physical interaction.</div>
          <li class="hide">Ayesha fakes a yawn intending to cause Ben to yawn.  </li>
          <li class="hide">Ayesha lays a trail of false footprints intended to deceive Ben.</li>
          <li class="hide">Ayesha waves at Ben with the intention that he will recognise that she intends him to come over.</li>
        </ol>
        <div data-what="li:eq(0)" data-class="blur-text" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div>
        <div data-what="li:eq(1)" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">Why are these actions non-communicative?  Ayesha intends her fake yawn to have an effect on Ben, but the effect is a physiological one.  The response she wants from him is mechanical.</div>
        <div class="notes">But there are also non-communicative actions which require a rational response from the people they’re directed at.  For example:</div>
        <div data-what="li:eq(1)" data-class="blur-text" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div>
        <div data-what="li:eq(2)" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">Note here that although Ayesha intends to provide Ben with misinformation, her action isn’t communicative.</div>
        <div class="notes">Intuitively, there’s a difference between deliberately providing information or misinformation to someone and communicating with her (Grice 1989: 218).  </div>
        <div class="notes">So what makes an action communicative?</div>
        <div class="notes">Paul Grice has a neat answer to this question.</div>
        <div class="notes">He notes that we sometimes achieve things merely by letting other people know that we intend to achieve them.</div>
        <div class="notes">Waving is one of the simplest examples:</div>
        <div data-what="li:eq(2)" data-class="blur-text" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div>
        <div data-what="li:eq(3)" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">In this example, Ayesha’s goal is to get Ben to come over.  Her means of achieving this is to get Ben to recognise that this is what she intends.  So when she waves, her intention is that waving will let Ben know that she intends him to come over.</div>
        <div class="slide em-above">
          <p>Goal: get Ben to come over</p>
          <p>Means: get Ben to recognise that I intend to get Ben to come over</p>

          <div class="notes">You can achieve some things just by letting people know that you intend to achieve them.  To achieve things in this way is to perform an act of communication.</div>

          <div class="notes">Why does this distinction matter?</div>
          <div class="notes">Grice’s explicates meaning and communication in terms of ulterior intentions.</div>
          <div class="notes">His project is to give a reductive analysis of these notions, meaning and communication.</div>
          <div class="notes">Ulterior intentions are precisely what is needed for such an analysis of meaning.</div>
          <div class="notes">This is because ulterior intentions ‘do not involve language, in the sense that their description does not have to mention language’ or any semantic concepts like meaning \citep[p.\ 298]{Davidson:1992pl}.</div>
          <div class="notes">But, Davidson points out, we don’t have to attempt an analysis of meaning and communication.</div>
          <div class="notes">After all, Grice’s analysis has been subject to plenty of counterexamples and objections \citep{Schiffer:1987zb}.</div>
          <div class="notes">(Davidson objects that ‘it is not clear that these principles [Grice’s] are designed to handle the gamut of examples we find in literature’ \citep[p.\ 300]{Davidson:1992pl}.</div>
          <div class="notes">\citet{Davidson:1991ic} discusses one literary example at length.  He argues that ‘Joyce takes us back to the foundations and origins of communication; he puts us in the situation of the jungle linguist trying to get the hand of a new language and a novel culture, to assume the perspective of someone who is an alien or an exile’ \citep[p.\ 11]{Davidson:1991ic}.)</div>

gestures with their referents is not sufficient for understanding them;  second, basic 
the pointing-referent associations may be grasped by non-communicators.

    <div class="notes">(Here the 'basic' qualifier is there because in some cases deciding on the referent may involve thinking about the agent and recepient, their knowledge and intentions.)</div>
