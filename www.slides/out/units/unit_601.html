          <div class="notes">This isn't a new question, but I think it's worth spending more time on it, partly because someone said in a seminar that we don't know what it is and partly because thinking about this is a way of organising much of what we've been learning.</div>

          <div class="notes">The first, very minor thing is to realise that there are two closely related notions, core knowledge and core system.</div>
          <div class="notes">The notion of a core system and that of a module are barely different; it's safe to treat these as interchangeable until you have a reason to distinguish them.</div>
          <div class="notes">These are related this: roughly, core knowledge states are the states of core systems.  More carefully:</div>
          <div class="handout notes">
            For someone to have \textit{core knowledge of a particular principle or fact} is for her to have a core system where 
            either the core system includes a representation of that principle or else the principle plays a special role in describing the core system.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">So we can define core knowlegde in terms of core system.</div>
          <div class="slide">

        <div class="notes">So to properly understand what they are we would need  (i) to have a deep understanding of the picture; (ii) and of the hypotheses it inspires; (iii) and of the evidence for these hypotheses, and then we would work back from this to say what core systems are.</div>
        <div class="notes">Now you might say that this is terrible, how can scientists use terms without defining them.</div>
        <div class="notes">But (a) it's not obvious that definitions are necessary for good science, or even that useful; and (b) compare the notion of knowledge: philosophers have made some informative observations about knowledge, but they've had no success at all in defining it.</div>

  <div class="notes">Limited accessbility is a familar feature of many cognitive systems.</div>
  <div class="notes">When you grasp an object with a precision grip, it turns out that there is a very reliable pattern.</div>
  <div class="notes">At a certain point in moving towards it your fingers will reach a maximum grip aperture which is normally a certain amount wider than the object to be grasped, and then start to close.</div>
  <div class="notes">Now there's no physiological reason why grasping should work like this, rather than grip hand closing only once you contact the object.</div>
  <div class="notes">Maximum grip aperture shows anticipation of the object: the mechanism responsible for guiding your action does so by representing various things including some features of the object.</div>
  <div class="notes">But we ordinarily have no idea about this.</div>
  <div class="notes">The discovery of how grasping is controlled depended on high speed photography.</div>
  <div class="notes">This is an illustration of limited accessibility.</div>

          <div class="notes">Let me pause to evalaute the picture I offered in lecture 1 in the light of what we've learnt so far.</div>
          <div class="notes">(I hesitate to do this because it shows the picture I offered you isn't very good.)</div>
          <div class="notes">Take each case in turn.</div>
          <div class="notes">For colour it works quite well, providing, as I suggested last week, that acquiring words is a creative process of social interaction.</div>
          <div class="notes">What about physical objects?  Here there's no indication that using labels for objects drives a developmental change, and it's hard to see why it would.</div>
          <div class="notes">(It's more plausible that tool use rather than word use matters; but even this is is hugely speculative.)</div>
          <div class="notes">So no marks for that case at all.</div>
          <div class="notes">What about minds, and in particular beliefs?</div>
          <div class="notes">Superficially things look better here.  There is both evidence that rich forms of social interaction facilitate development \citep{Hughes:2006fu}</div>
          <div class="notes">and also evidence that language matters in various ways \citep{Astington2005ot}.</div>
          <div class="notes">But these probably don't connect in the simple way I envisage.</div>
          <div class="notes">Social interaction might matter because it provides experiences of perspective differences, or because it motivates children to think about others' minds.</div>
          <div class="notes">And language might matter because having sentences around enables them to keep track of beliefs, or because using relative clauses might clue them in to a relation between beliefs and what utterances of sentences express.</div>
          <div class="notes">So here the picture isn't right, but it might not be a million miles off either ...</div>
          <div class="notes">It's wrong to think that labelling beliefs matters; but it may be that being able to talk about beliefs (implicitly or otherwise) does matter for coming to have knowledge of them.</div>
