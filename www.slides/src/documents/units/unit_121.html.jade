    Categorical perception of colour emerges early in infancy. This has been demonstrated with four-month-olds using habituation \citep{Bornstein:1976of} and
    visual search \citep{Franklin:2005xk}.
  .handout: :t
    Slightly older infants can make use of colour properties such as red and green to recognise objects.  
    For instance, nine-months-olds can determine whether an object they saw earlier is the same as a subsequently presented object on the basis of its colour
    \citep{Wilcox:2008jk}.
  .handout: :t
    By the time they are two years old, toddlers who do not comprehend any colour words can use colour categories implicitly in learning and using proper names;
    for instance, they are able to learn and use proper names for toy dinosaurs that differ only in colour \citep[][Experiment 3]{Soja:1994np}.
  .handout: :t
    So infants and toddlers enjoy categorical perception of colour and may benefit from it in recognising and learning about objects.  
  .handout: :t
    However children only acquire concepts of, and words for, colours some time later; and colour concepts, like colour words, are acquired gradually
    \citep{Pitchford:2005hm,Kowalski:2006hk,Sandhofer:1999if,Sandhofer:2006qo}.

      .notes So we see categorical perception of colour early in development and it is useful to children.

    Infants enjoy categorical perception not only of colour but also of orientation \citep{franklin:2010_hemispheric}, speech
    \citep{Kuhl:1987la,Kuhl:2004nv,Jusczyk:1995it} and facial expressions of emotion \citep{Etcoff:1992zd,Kotsoni:2001ph,Campanella:2002aa}.

    facial expressions of emotion (Etcoff & Magee 1992; Kotsoni et al. 2001; Campanella et al. 2002).
