        <p class="right">(Russell 1921, p. 71)</p>

        <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">But how does the environment determine habits and associations?</div>
        <div class="slide em-above step2">
          <div class="notes">Wittgenstein suggests that the habits are determined by training.</div>
          <p class="handout show">‘[t]he child learns this language from the grown-ups by being trained to its use. I am using the word ‘trained’ in a way strictly analogous to that in which we talk of an animal being trained to do certain things. It is done by means of example, reward, punishment, and suchlike’</p>

        <div class="slide em-above step3">
          <div class="notes">One answer is suggested by Quine.</div>
          <p class="handout show">‘the child’s early learning of a verbal response depends on society's reinforcement of the response in association with the stimulations that merit the response’</p>
          <div class="handout ctd">(\citep[p.\ 82]{Quine:1960fe}; compare \citep[pp.\ 28--9]{Quine:1974rd})</div>

          <div class="notes">So this is the picture.</div>
          <div class="notes">For each word, there is a set of 'stimulations' in response to which an utterance of that word would be appropriate.</div>
          <div class="notes">For instance, we might suppose there's a set of banana stimulations in response to which an utterance of the word 'banana' would be appropriate.</div>
          <div class="notes">The child then comes to use the word 'banana' in response to the bananana-stimuluations by means of being trained.</div>
          <div class="notes">She is rewarded for using 'banana' correctly or punished for using it incorrectly (or both) and so she gradually zeros in on the correct pattern of use.</div>

        <div class="handout">‘Before we have an idea of truth or error, before the advent of concepts or propositional thought, </div>
        <p>‘<span class="handout ctd show">there is a rudiment of communication in the simple discovery that sounds produce results. Crying is the first step toward language when crying is found to procure one or another form of relief or satisfaction. More specific sounds, imitated or not, are rapidly associated with more specific pleasures.</span></p>
        <div class="handout ctd">Here use //p. 71// would be meaning, if anything like intention and meaning were in the picture.  </div>
        <p class="slide">‘<span class="handout ctd show">A large further step has been taken when the child notices that others also make distinctive sounds at the same time the child is having the experiences that provoke its own volunteered sounds. </span><span class="handout ctd">For the adult, these sounds have a meaning, perhaps as one word sentences. The adult sees herself as doing a little ostensive teaching: “Eat,” “Red,” “Ball,” “Mamma,” “Milk,” “No.” </span><span class="slide handout show">There is now room for what the adult views as error: the child says “Block” when it is a slab. This move fails to be rewarded, and the conditioning becomes more complex’ </span></p>
