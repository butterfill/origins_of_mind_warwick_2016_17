On one picture the infant is an outsider who might as well be observing those around her through a telescope.
On the other picture the child is a blank to be shaped by those around her.
There is no meaningful interaction between the infant and adults around her; or, if there is, it makes no difference to her development.
But could there be a role for social interaction in learning the meanings of words?

          <div class="notes">Individually or in groups these children invent their own signed languages.</div>
          <div class="notes">These languages are not as rich as those of children with experience of other people's languages but they have all of the essential features of language including lexicons and syntax (Goldin-Meadow 2002, 2003).</div>
          <div class="notes">The children invent gesture forms for words which they use with the same meanings in different contexts, they adopt standard orderings for combining words into sentences, and they use sentences in constructing narratives about past, present, future and hypothetical events.  Thus one profoundly deaf child, Qing, describes how swordfish can poke a person so that she dies, and how they have long, straight noses and can swim (Goldin-Meadow 2003: 170).  </div>

          <div class="notes">I started this section by contrasting two views on lexical acquisition, the shipwreck survivor view and the lab rat view.</div>
          <div class="notes">We've seen that neither is the whole truth because children learn in part through a process of creation.</div>
          <div class="notes">Why is this interesting?</div>
          <div class="notes">The creative activity is a rational, goal-directed activity; so it's not merely training.</div>
          <div class="notes">The creative activity does not obviously involve mapping words onto concepts, or even having the concepts.</div>
          <div class="notes">(After all, the child might try out a pattern of use that others see as appropriate for a concept before the child actually has that concept.)</div>
          <div class="notes">And this creativity with words involves social interaction: the aim is coordination between two or more individuals.</div>
          <div class="notes">So: </div>
          <p class="notes show">Language acquisition is neither merely a matter of training, nor merely a matter of reasoning 
about the meanings of words.
Rather, it involves social interaction from the first utterances of words.
