    This is a lecture about the origins of our knowledge of causal interactions, but I want to 
    return to the topic of objects and the problem we encountered in the last lecture.
  .notes: :t()
    As I keep saying, knowledge of objects depends on abilities to (i) segment objects, 
    (ii) represent them as persisting and (iii) track their interactions.
  p Three requirements
  ul
    li segment objects
    li represent objects as persisting
    li track objects’ interactions
  .slide
    .notes: :t()
      When we asked how infants meet these three requirements, we found that a single set of principles,
      the Principles of Object Perception, seemed to underlie all three abilities.
    p Principles of Object Perception
    ul.blur1
      li cohesion
      li boundedness
      li rigidity
      li no action at a distance
    p.right (Spelke 1990)
    .notes: :t()
      We were then led to the question, What is the status of these principles?
      It's one thing to say that they describe how infants perform; but what we want is some
      understanding of the mechanisms.

  p.center.simple-view the Simple View
  .notes: :t()
    The Simple View is one way to get a mechanism out of the principles.
    Recall that the \emph{simple view} is the view that #{origins.simple_view}.
  +line-through('.simple-view')
  .notes: :t()
    Unfortunately, as we saw, the Simple View is wrong.
    We know it is wrong because it makes systematically incorrect predictions about infants' actions.
    These arise from a discrepancy between measures that involve looking times or eye movements
    and measures that involve 
    other kinds of action, such as searching and pulling.
  .notes: :t()
    At the end of the last lecture (on objects), I said that the failure of the Simple View 
    leaves us with a problem.
    We are now, at least, in a position to take a step towards solving that problem.

    Their upshot is not knowledge about particular objects and their movements but rather a 
    perceptual representation involving an object index.

    This amazing discovery is going to take us a while to fully digest.  As a first step, note its
    significance for Davidson's challenge about characterising what is going on in the head of the 
    child who has a few words, or even no words.
  .notes: :t()
    [*TODO*] \citep{keane:2006_motion} suggests that `If early vision gathers trajectory 
    information, that information cannot reliably be utilized to extrapolate in MOT.'  If this is
    right, either object files aren't FINSTs and the link between object files and multiple-object
    tracking (MOT) is wrong; or else the claim on this slide identifying principles of object
    perception and object indexes is wrong!

  .notes: :t()
    The discovery that the principles of object perception characterise the operation of 
    object-indexes doesn't mean we have met the challenge exactly.
    We haven't found a way of describing the processes and representations that underpin infants'
    abilities to deal with objects and causes.
    However, we have reduced the problem of doing this to the problem of characterising how 
    some perceptual mechanisms work.  
    And this shows, importantly, that understanding infants' minds is not something different from
    understanding adults' minds, contrary to what Davidson assumes.
    The problem is not that their cognition is half-formed or in an intermediate state.
    The problem is just that understanding perception requires science and not just intuition.

    Let me make some more points about it.
  .notes: :t()
    First, it doesn't fully answer our question about the relation between the Principles of Object
    Perception and mechanisms in infants.  
    It tells us that the Principles characterise a certain kind of perceptual process.
    This is progress; but we can still ask about the nature of the procesess and representations 
    involved.  This will become important when we consider knowledge in other domains.
  .notes: :t()
    Second, we haven't fully explained the discrepancy between looking and action-based measures for 
    representing objects as persisting and tracking their causal interactions.
    After all, why do these perceptual representations of objects--the object indexes--not guide 
    purposive actions like reaching and pulling?
    This is an issue we shall return to. 
  .notes: :t()
    Third, it leaves us with a question we didn't have before.
    What is the relation between these abilities to segment objects, represent them as persisting 
    and track their causal interactions and knowledge about objects?
    Clearly having an object-index stuck to an object is not the same thing as having knowledge
    about the object's location and movements.  (If it were, we'd face just the problems that are 
    fatal for the Simple View.)
    What then is the relation between these things?
  .notes: :t()
    This third point is related to an issue about the relation between infant and adult capacities,
    one that  I raised at the start of this lecture ...
    

// *todo duplicated in other units

  .notes: :t()
    What is the relation between infants' competencies with objects and adults'?
    Is it that infants' competencies grow into more sophisticated adult competencies?
    Or is it that they remain constant throught development, and are supplemented by quite 
    separate abilities?

  .notes: :t()
    The identification of the Principles of Object Perception with object-indexes suggests that 
    infants' abilities are constant throughout development.
    They do not become adult conceptual abilities; rather they remain as perceptual systems
    that somehow underlie later-developing abilities to acquire knowledge.
  .notes: :t()
    Confirmation for this view comes from considering that there are discrepancies in adults' 
    performances which resemble the discrepancies in infants between looking and action-based 
    measures of competence ...
