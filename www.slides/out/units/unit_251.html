        <div class="notes handout">Infants at around six months of age seem also to distinguish launching from other sequences, 
much as adults do \citep{Leslie:1987nr}.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">[nb: Several people have discussed this in seminars so I won't discuss it here (the reference is on your handout).]
        </div>
        <div class="notes">In their experiment, they compared two groups of infants.
The first group was habituated to the top display, which is just the sort of animation Michotte
used to get reports of causal experiences in adults.
After habituation, this first group was then shown the same display except that the direction was 
reversed.
Meanwhile a second group was habituated to a display like the top display here except 
that there was a delay between the first object stopping and the second object starting.
This delay would mean that, in adults, there are no reports of experiences of a causal interaction.
After habituation, this second group was shown the same display except that the direction of 
movement was reversed.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Of interest was whether the first group showed greater dishabituation to the reversal than 
the second group.
How could this tell us anything about infants' experiences?
Suppose that infants do not have anything like what adults report as an experience of causation.
They they experience merely patterns of movement.
And, in this case, reversing on sequence should create no more interest than reversing the other.
But now suppose that infants do have something like what adults report as an experience 
of causation?
Then, when reversing the first sequence, there are two changes: there is a change both to the 
movement and to the character of the causal interaction.  To put it informally,
reversing direction means that the patient of the interaction becomes its agent.
So the hypothesis that infants' experiences of Michotte-like stimuli resemble adults 
predicts that there will be greater dishabituation when the first, `direct launching` sequence 
is reversed.

        <div class="notes">Part of the answer is this.  We don't worry about the content of the verbal reports.
We just focus on the fact that their content changes depending on a tiny, 50 millisecond

Call this \emph{launching effect}.

                <div class="notes">Causal capture is described by \citep{Scholl:2002eb}.
As I said,
normally, if the two balls overlap completely, subjects report seeing a single object 
changing colour.
But if we show subjects a sequence like the launching effect but where the first square 
overlaps the second's position before it moves.  When this event is shown is isolation 
almost all subjects see it as a single object changing colour.  But when the event is 
shown with an 
unambiguous launching effect nearby, almost all subjects now see the 'overlap' event as 
a launching.
Causal capture means that we can show subjects a sequence with complete overlap and 
still have the report a causal effect.

                <div class="notes">Why do we care about causal capture?  Because it gives rise to illusory causal 
crescents ...

        <div class="notes handout">‘when there is a launching event beneath the overlap (or underlap event) timed such that 
the launch occurs at the point of maximum overlap, observers inaccurately report that 
the overlap is incomplete, suggesting that they see an illusory crescent.’ 
\citep[p.\ 461]{Scholl:2004dx}
        </div>
        <div class="notes handout">Why does the illusory causal crescent appear?  Scholl and Nakayama suggest a  
‘a simple categorical explanation for the Causal Crescents illusion: the visual system, 
when led by other means to perceive an event as a causal collision, effectively 
‘refuses’ to see the two objects as fully overlapped, because of an internalized 
constraint to the effect that such a spatial arrangement is not physically possible. 
As a result, a thin crescent of one object remains uncovered by the other one-as 
would in fact be the case in a straight-on billiard-ball collision where the motion 
occurs at an angle close to the line of sight.’

Contrast Spelke’s view.
‘objects are conceived: Humans come to know about an object’s unity, boundaries, and 
persistence in ways like those by which we come to know about its material composition 
or its market value.’
\citep[p.\ 198]{Spelke:1988xc}.

          <li>Adults report experiencing a launching effect.</li>
          <li>These reports show that they can make minute distinctions.<span class="notes">They can detect tiny, 50 millisecond differences in the delay between two movements.</span></li>
          <li>Infants detect apparent causal interactions from 6 months of age or earlier.</li>
          <li>Detecting apparent causal interactions is bound up with perceiving objects.<span class="notes">It's not that we first perceive objects and surfaces, and then identify causal interactions.
Rather, identifying causal interactions is part of perceiving surfaces and objects.  
So the launching effect does seem to involve perceptual processes.</span></li>
