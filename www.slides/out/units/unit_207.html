It is perhaps hard to accept that four-month-old infants are in the business of formulating and revising hypotheses.
(Come to think of it, it’s quite hard to accept that adults typically acquire representations of unperceived objects by formulating and revising hypotheses.)
Also we might think of inference as something that a detective does.  It is not obvious that the same process is occurring in infants.
But these considerations are narrowly intuitive.
Science sometimes indicates that intuitions are wrong, even intuitions about very fundamental things like space and time.
And, most importantly, if infants aren’t making inferences on the basis of knowlegde, what are they doing that enables them to pass violation-of-expectation tasks?

          <div class="notes">What about the chicks and dogs?
This isn't straightforward.
As I mentioned earlier, \citep{kundey:2010_domesticated} show that domestic dogs are good 
at solidity on a search measure.  And as we covered in seminars, 
\citep{chiandetti:2011_chicks_op} demonstrate object permanence with a search measure in 
chicks that are just a few days old.
Indeed, for many of the other animals I mentioned, object permanence is measured in search 
tasks, not with looking times.
To speculate, it may be that the looking/search dissociation is more likely to occur in
adult animals the more closely related they are to humans.
But let's focus on the fact that you get the looking/search in any adult animals at all.
This is evidence that the dissociation is a consequence of something fundamental about 
cognition rather than just a side-effect of some capacity limit.
