        <div class="notes">Until quite recently it was held, following Piaget and others, that these three abilities appeared relatively late in development.  </div>
        <div class="notes">However, as we saw last week, more recent investigations provide strong evidence that all three abilities are present in humans from around four months of age or earlier.  </div>

          We've seen that infants' abilities to segement objects, represent them as persisting and track their causal 
          interactions can be described by appeal to a single set of principles, 
          the principles of cohension, boundedness, rigidity and no action at a distance.

          <div class="notes">Let's suppose that Spelke is right that the principles are \emph{formally adequate}.</div>
          <div class="notes">That is, someone who knew the principles and had unlimited cognitive resources could use the principles to infer the track physical objects through simple causal interactions like those we've been considering.</div>
          <div class="notes">(So formal adequacy is a question of what is possible in principle.)</div>
          <div class="notes">I don't think we should question this.</div>
          <ul>
            <li>formal adequacy</li>
            <li class="slide">descriptive adequacy
              <div class="notes">I also want to allow that Spelke's principles are \emph{descriptively adeqaute}.
That is, they successfully describe how infants, adults and nonhumans deal with various situations.
We can think of this in terms of \emph{as if}: it is as if these individuals are using the principles.
But we have yet to come to what really matters to Spelke and to us.
For accepting formal and descriptive adequacy is consistent with denying that Carey and Spelke's claim that ‘A single system of knowledge … appears to [does] underlie object perception and physical reasoning’ \citep[p.\ 175]{Carey:1994bh}.
              </div>
              <div class="notes">That's because formal and descriptive adequacy leave open the question of what mechanisms are involved in tracking physical objects' causal interactions.</div>

              <div class="notes">Finally, we might claim that these principles are realised in the cognitive mechansisms invovled in object tracking.</div>
