          <div class="notes">Recall from the previous lecture that our Next Big Problem is this. 
We've said that infants' competence with causes and objects is not knowledge but something 
more primitive than knowledge, something which exists in adults too and can carry information 
discrepant with what they know. So, if at all, how does appealing to these early capacities 
enable us to explain the origins of knowledge?
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Versions of this problem will arise in every domain of knowledge we shall consider.
In this lecture I want to consider our Next Big Problem by thinking about the domain of colour.
We are also, of course, simultaneously occupied with a question about the origins of knowledge
of colour.
Let me start by introducing the question ...

<section class="slide">
  <div class="notes">Let me start with something quite basic.
Here are three patches of colour.
The patches are all different colours, but the two leftmost are both the same colour---they are both blue.
This sounds contradictory but isn't.
In one case we're talking about the particular colours of things; in the other case we're talking about colour category.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">The question I want to ask about knowledge of colour concerns these cateories. 
You know that these two are both blue whereas this is not (it's green).
How do you come to know this?
(Ask them to discuss.)
Does anyone thing the answer is that you can just see it?  As we'll see, that idea looks promising initiall but it's not quite that simple.

  <div class="notes">Another measure on which the green sequence differs from the blue-pink-purple sequence is pop-out, which is defined operationally in terms of visual search tasks \citep[p.\ 117]{Treisman:1986pm}.</div>
  <div class="notes">First I need to explain what a visual search task is.</div>
  <div class="notes">In visual search tasks tasks, subjects are shown an array of objects and asked to identify the one with a certain property.</div>
  <div class="notes">For example, one might be shown an array of twenty animal pictures and asked to identify the cat.</div>
  <div class="notes">Normally the time it takes subjects to find a target increases linearly as the number of objects in the array increases.</div>
  <div class="notes">But when the target of a visual search is defined in terms of colour and the colours of the distractors are categorically different from the colour of the target, subjects can find the target just as quickly when it is in among 36 distractors as when there are only four distractors \citep[Experiment 1]{Daoutis:2006qk}.</div>
  <div class="notes">This is, the colours pop out.</div>
  <div class="handout">\textbf{pop-out} ‘Such targets pop out of the display, so that the time it takes to find them is independent of the number of distractors’ \citep[p.\ 117]{Treisman:1986pm}.</div>

We've said that infants' competence with causes and objects is not knowledge but something 
more primitive than knowledge, something which exists in adults too and can carry information 
discrepant with what they know. So, if at all, how does appealing to these early capacities 
enable us to explain the origins of knowledge?

Perhaps we can partially resolve the Next Big Problem in the case of colour, and then use 
this as a model for other cases.

        <p class="em-above notes show">In acquiring a colour concept or word you need to:</p>
        <ol>

        <div class="notes">On locating the boundaries, I think having colour words might be helpful as a way of 
marking a category before you know where its boundaries are.
That is, the word allows you to re-identify a category without knowing where it begins 
or ends.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Given differences between the boundaries of pre-verbal infants' perceptual categories
and the extensions of colour words, it seems unlikely that categorical perception could 
help here.  (Although it is possible in principle that, due to abstract features common to 
all languages' systems of colour words, categorical perception might help; see Kay and ?*.)

        <div class="notes">It's with this first problem that I think categorical perception helps with.
I suggest that categorical perception enables you to lock onto the relevant dimension.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">How?
Categorical perception alters your experience so that there's a correspondence between 
(i) changes on the relevant dimension, and (ii) changes in one phenomenal aspect of your 
experience.
This correspondence helps you, eventually, to lock onto the relevant dimension and so to 
acquire concepts and words.
Let me illustrate.

  <div class="notes">One effect of categorical perception is phenomenological.</div>
  <div class="notes">Consider the (a) difference between an experience of the first blue and the second blue;</div>
  <div class="notes">and (b) the difference between an experience of the second blue and the green.</div>
  <div class="notes">Phenomenally, the second pair of experiences is more different than the first.</div>
  <div class="notes">There is some kind of phenomenological marker of categorical colour properties.</div>
  <div class="notes">To put it colourfully, there is something that it is like for you to experience blue, and something else that it is like for you to experience green.</div>
  <div class="notes">So, to return to the two problems, this is why I think categorical perception might be important for identifying the dimension.</div><img src="/img/slide_cp_02.jpg" class="bkg"/>

  <div class="notes">This picture is about core knowledge, but I think we should broaden that to include categorical perception.</div>
  <div class="notes">In fact I think core knowledge and categorical perception are likely to be closely related, as I'll explain later.</div>
  <div class="notes">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="notes">The question for this lecture was, how do we come to know things about colour.</div>
  <div class="notes">The answer, I think, is this.</div>
  <div class="notes">We have categorical perception of colour from early in infancy, certainly from around four months of age.</div>
  <div class="notes">Having categorical perception is not by itself sufficient for having colour concepts.</div>
  <div class="notes">But it does play an important role, because it means that there is <span>a correspondence between (i) changes on the relevant dimension, and (ii) changes in one phenomenal aspect of our experience.</span></div>
  <div class="notes">I conjecture that this helps us to identify the relevant dimension, colour not shape or size, in acquiring colour words and concepts.</div>
  <div class="notes">But by itself this is not enough.</div>
  <div class="notes">As we've seen, acquiring colour concepts also depends on having some colour words.</div>
  <div class="notes">I speculate that this is because words function as a tool for marking categories prior to knowing where they start and end.</div>
  <div class="notes">The word allows you to re-identify a category without knowing where it begins or ends.</div>
  <div class="notes">So this is my picture.</div>
  <div class="notes">Acquiring knowledge of colour depends on an interaction between categorical perception, something developmentally quite primitive, and social interaction, in particular the negotiation of words for colour categories.</div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
  <div class="notes">To conclude, we've seen that although infants enjoy categorical perception of colour from four months or earlier,</div>
  <div class="notes">this doesn't straightforwardly explain how they come to know about the colours of things.</div>
  <div class="notes">In particular, having categorical perception does not entail having a concept.</div>
  <div class="notes">Nor does having a concept seem to be a matter of somehow redescribing or latching on to what is catgeorically perceived.</div>
  <div class="notes">On the other hand, having colour words and being able to use them accurately does seeem to matter for the acquisition of knowledge of colour.</div>
  <div class="notes">So this is one example where having verbal labels for things may help with acquiring concepts of them.</div>

This is deliberate because the notion is tricky; so I thought it would be good to postpone
our discussion of it for as long as possible.
Now I can put it off no longer.

          <div class="notes">The first, very minor thing is to realise that there are two closely related notions, core 
knowledge and core system.
These are related this: roughly, core knowledge states are the states of core systems.  More 
carefully:
          </div>
          <div class="handout notes">
            For someone to have \textit{core knowledge of a particular principle or fact} is for her to have a core system where 
            either the core system includes a representation of that principle or else the principle plays a special role in describing the core system.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">So we can define core knowlegde in terms of core system.</div>

        <div class="notes">They talk about things like perceiving colour, depth or melodies.</div>
        <div class="notes">Now, as we saw when talking about categorical perception of colour, we can think of the 'system' underlying categorical perception as largely separate from other cognitive systems--- we saw that they could be knocked out by verbal interference, for example.</div>
        <div class="notes">So the idea is that core knowledge somehow involves a system that is separable from other cognitive mechanisms.</div>
        <div class="notes">As Carey rather grandly puts it, understanding core knowledge will involve understanding something about 'the architecture of the mind'.</div>

        <div class="notes">To sum up, there are two problems with the notion of core knowledge ...</div>
        <div class="notes show">
          <p>core systems -- questions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Is appealing to core systems (modules) explanatory?</li>
            <li>Can the Core Knowledge View explain the discrepancy?</li>
            <li>Is the view I've been developing consisten with the Core Knowledge View?</li>
            <li>Is core knowledge all one thing?</li>
            <li>How do you get from core knowledge to knowledge knowledge?</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The Core Knowledge View is the view that infants' competence with objects, causes, colours
and the rest depends not on knowledge (as the Simple View has it) but on core knowledge.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the first question, I could tell you a long story about computational processes and 
representational formats.  But I won't do that here.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the second question, I think the answer is probably yes because the difference in
representational formats between knowledge proper and core knowledge explains limited
accessibility, and this in turn partially explains the discrepancies.
(But note that it doesn't explain is why the discrepacies fall exactly where they do.)
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the third question, I think that thinking about categorical perception, or the perceptual 
systems that underpin objects indexes is a way of getting at what core knowledge really 
involves.  Core systems are not always something over and above perceptual and motor systems
(although it seems probably that they sometimes are if our competence with syntax rests on 
core knowledge).
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the fourth question,
Most people are committed to there being different stories for (a) colour (categorical 
perception); (b) syntax (tacit knowledge); and (c) physical objects.
I'm not sure. I'm tempted to think that perceptual and motor cognition are at the root of these 
in every case, but this is a radical idea for which there is currenly very little evidence.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The fifth question is just a variant of what I called The Problem (see lecture 2; it arises 
from the failure of the Simple View).

  <div class="notes">Our question was how humans make the transition from not being in a position to know that these are blue but this is not to being in a position to know this.</div>
  <div class="notes">The appearance of categorical perception of colour at around four months of age made attractive the idea that the knowledge might come from, or be based on, perception.</div>
  <div class="notes">The tempting thought was that categorical perception of colour somehow provides a building block for colour concepts.</div>
  <div class="notes">We saw that there were some reasons, not conclusive but quite powerful, to reject this idea.</div>
  <div class="notes">In its place I offered a conjecture about development as rediscovery.</div>
  <div class="notes">That conjecture was that in thought we rediscover something that our brains are already able to process, namely colour categories.</div>
  <div class="notes">This suggests a certain amount of duplication.  There's both a low-level cognitive process and a conceptual processes that deal with colour, that are not directly linked by representations but rather only indirectly, via experience, the body and behaviour.</div>
  <div class="notes">What we've just seen is that there is even more duplication than this suggests.</div>
  <div class="notes">There are not just one but two perceptual processes which are concerned with categorising colour.</div>
