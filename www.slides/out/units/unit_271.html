For example, we saw (in the previous lecture) that infants expect objects to be in certain 
locations, or to appear at 
certain points in space.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">What is the status of these expectations?
Our recent identification of the Principles of Object Perception with the operation of object
indexes suggests that the expectations are in some sense perceptual.
But what are perceptual expectations?
And do adults also have perceptual expectations?

Suppose you saw this image.
The triangle behind the thumb is in some sense perceptually present, even though you can't see 
it.

        <div class="notes">But now the thumb comes away and what you see is not the triangle you were expecting.
Could these perceptual expectations be just a matter of knowledge?
No, because perceptual expectations are judgement-independent.
As \citep{kellman:1983_perception} report, Michotte, Thines and Crabbe found that subjects 
report seeing a single large triangle behind the thumb even when they know that there isn't one 
there.
You can cover and reveal the triangles repeatedly, but the expectation will hold firm.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The experience you have when the thumb is removed is like that of infants' in 
violation-of-expectation tasks.

          <div class="notes">You see an object move on a screen in some way.
The screen goes blank and you are asked to say where the object was last.
Subjects typically locate the object just a bit further on, as if it had continued moving after 
the screen went blank.
This is called representational momentum as a sort of joke; the idea is that the representation 
keeps moving if the object stop abruptly enough.
It's not interesting in itself, but it's useful for us.
Why is it useful?  Because it can tell us about the paths that the perceptual system expects 
objects to travel on.

Important because it shows limits (people know better than their perceptual systems)

        <div class="notes">adults, including trained physicists who make correct verbal predictions about the effects of 
mass on motion, show representational momentum (a perceptual effect) consistent with impetus 
and inconsistent with Newtonian mechanics.  So again we have (i) judgement-independence and 
(ii) adults.  ('both physics experts and novices possess the same set of implicit beliefs about 
motion.' \citep[p.\ 451]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus})
--- limits of infants' systems found in adults shows that we can identify the system as 
persisting 
--- note that other studies also show judgement-independence, but in the other way (implicit 
knowledge of physical interactions more accurate than judgement: 'a number of previous studies 
suggesting a dissociation between explicit and implicit knowledge of the principles of physics. 
For instance, Hubbard suggests that implicit knowledge reflects internalization of invariant 
physical principles, whereas explicit knowledge about motion may be less accurate. Similarly, 
Krist et al. (1993) suggested that perceptually based knowledge is more accurate than verbal 
concepts of motion.' \citep[p.\ 450]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus}
--- What questions does this bear on?  (1) perceptual & modular nature of infants' 
understanding of objects and their interactions; (2) relation between infant competence and 
adults' (do the thing about system being transformed or discarded versus two systems persisting 
through development : this is different from issues about innateness, which looks from 
infants' competence backwards --- here we go in the other direction, looking forwards); and 
(3) trade-offs between flexibility and efficiency (see below; worth talking about this in some 
detail here)
--- on cognitive efficiency:  	`To extrapolate objectsâ€™ motion on the basis of physical 
principles, one should have assessed and evaluated the presence and magnitude of such 
imperceptible forces as friction and air resistance operating in the real world.  This would 
require a time-consuming analysis that is not always possible. In order to have a survival 
advantage, the process of extrapolation should be fast and effortless, without much conscious 
deliberation. Impetus theory allows us to extrapolate objectsâ€™ motion quickly and without large 
demands on attentional resources.' \citep[p.\ 450]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus}
**caution (basically fine, but need to be careful): 'The extent to which displacement reflects 
physical principles per se has been widely debated in the literature; theories of displacement 
suggest a variety of potential effects of physical principles ranging from an incorporation of 
the principle of momentum into mental representation (e.g., Finke et al., 1986) to a rejection 
of any internalization of physical principles (e.g., Kerzel, 2000, 2003a). The empirical 
evidence is clear that (1) displacement does not always correspond to predictions based on 
physical principles and (2) variables unrelated to physical principles (e.g., the presence of 
landmarks, target identity, or expectations regarding a change in target direction) can 
influence displacement. ... information based on a naive understanding of physical principles 
or on subjective consequences of physical principles appears to be just one of many types of 
information that could potentially contribute to the displacement of any given target'

          <div class="notes">Why is it significant that representational momenutum in adults is consistent with
objects obeying impetus mechanics rather than Newtonian mechanics?
          </div>
          <div class="notes">There are two reasons.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">First, the signature limits provide us with a means to identify infant with adult cognition.
If both infants and adults are subjects to the same signature limits, namely those associated
with impetus mechanics, then we can infer that the representations of physical objects in 
adult 's perceptual processes originate from the same source as infants' representations of 
physical objects.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Second, it shows that the perceptual expectations involved in the representational momentum
are distinct from judgements.  You would not expect representational momentum to guide 
purposive actions that are separated in time from the perceptual experiences.

        <div class="notes">Recall that in infants we found discrepancies between some looking and some action-based 
measures of abilities to track causal interactions.
While I don't think we are yet in a position to explain these discrepancies, we can identify 
them with discrepancies that are also found in adults.
I suggest that
the discrepancies bewteen perceptual expectations and verbal judgements in adults have the same
source
as the discrepancies bewteen some looking and action-based measures in infants.
Their explanation lies in the nature of perceptual expectations.
