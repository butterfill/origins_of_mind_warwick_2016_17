          <p class="center">Yet Another Problem</p>
          <div class="notes">If the shipwreck survivor view were right, communication with words would not help us to explain
the emergence of abilities to know things about objects, causes, colours and the rest.
After all, it presupposes some knowledge of these things.
And, anyway, the shipwreck survivor view seems not to get at the hardest parts of how 
children come to communicate with words because it cannot handle their creativity.
It is based on a mistaken view about the nature of words as being conventionally linked to 
concepts.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">The lab rat view would help, since it presupposes no knowledge in the acquisition of abilities 
to communicate with words.
But the lab rat view is as clearly wrong as any view in philosophy.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">So our Next Big Problem was to understand how early developing capacities lead to knowledge.
My proposal was that we tackle this by thinking about social interaction, and language 
acquisition in particular.
But this has merely led us to Yet Another Problem.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">The problem is that we don't know how children might first come to communicate with words.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">To make progress with this problem it may be useful to switch from thinking about communication
with words to thinking about non-verbal communication ...
(But in the appendix I try to sketch a rough idea.)
