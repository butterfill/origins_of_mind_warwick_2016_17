return to the topic of objects and the problem we encountered in the last lecture.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">As I keep saying, knowledge of objects depends on abilities to (i) segment objects, 
(ii) represent them as persisting and (iii) track their interactions.

          <li>track objects’ interactions</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="slide">
          <div class="notes">When we asked how infants meet these three requirements, we found that a single set of principles,
the Principles of Object Perception, seemed to underlie all three abilities.
          </div>
          <p>Principles of Object Perception</p>
          <ul class="blur1">

          <div class="notes">We were then led to the question, What is the status of these principles?
It's one thing to say that they describe how infants perform; but what we want is some
understanding of the mechanisms.

          <div class="notes">The Simple View is one way to get a mechanism out of the principles.
Recall that the \emph{simple view} is the view that the principles of object perception are things that we know or believe, and we generate expectations from these principles by a process of inference..

          <div class="notes">Unfortunately, as we saw, the Simple View is wrong.
We know it is wrong because it makes systematically incorrect predictions about infants' actions.
These arise from a discrepancy between measures that involve looking times or eye movements
and measures that involve 
other kinds of action, such as searching and pulling.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">At the end of the last lecture (on objects), I said that the failure of the Simple View 
leaves us with a problem.
We are now, at least, in a position to take a step towards solving that problem.

        <div class="notes">The discovery that the principles of object perception characterise the operation of 
object-indexes doesn't mean we have met the challenge exactly.
We haven't found a way of describing the processes and representations that underpin infants'
abilities to deal with objects and causes.
However, we have reduced the problem of doing this to the problem of characterising how 
some perceptual mechanisms work.  
And this shows, importantly, that understanding infants' minds is not something different from
understanding adults' minds, contrary to what Davidson assumes.
The problem is not that their cognition is half-formed or in an intermediate state.
The problem is just that understanding perception requires science and not just intuition.

          <div class="notes">Let me make some more points about it.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">First, it doesn't fully answer our question about the relation between the Principles of Object
Perception and mechanisms in infants.  
It tells us that the Principles characterise a certain kind of perceptual process.
This is progress; but we can still ask about the nature of the procesess and representations 
involved.  This will become important when we consider knowledge in other domains.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Second, we haven't fully explained the discrepancy between looking and action-based measures for 
representing objects as persisting and tracking their causal interactions.
After all, why do these perceptual representations of objects--the object indexes--not guide 
purposive actions like reaching and pulling?
This is an issue we shall return to.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Third, it leaves us with a question we didn't have before.
What is the relation between these abilities to segment objects, represent them as persisting 
and track their causal interactions and knowledge about objects?
Clearly having an object-index stuck to an object is not the same thing as having knowledge
about the object's location and movements.  (If it were, we'd face just the problems that are 
fatal for the Simple View.)
What then is the relation between these things?
          </div>
          <div class="notes">This third point is related to an issue about the relation between infant and adult capacities,
one that  I raised at the start of this lecture ...

  <div class="notes">The identification of the Principles of Object Perception with object-indexes suggests that 
infants' abilities are constant throughout development.
They do not become adult conceptual abilities; rather they remain as perceptual systems
that somehow underlie later-developing abilities to acquire knowledge.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">Confirmation for this view comes from considering that there are discrepancies in adults' 
performances which resemble the discrepancies in infants between looking and action-based 
measures of competence ...
