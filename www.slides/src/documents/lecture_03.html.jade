 PLAN (also for book rewrite)
 
 issue: include perception of causation in adults?
 
 (a) Have already done Infants really do represent unperceived objects
 (b) Now show that these representations are not beliefs
     because the Simple View generates incorrect predictions.
 (c) In particular, the Simple View can’t explain the 
     Charles & Rivera double dissociation (occlusion/endarkening vs v-of-e/search);
     and even if they are wrong in detail, they are surely right that mode of
     disappearance stands in need of explanation.
 (d) representation / strength ?
 (e) core knowledge? Not explanatory of the pattern (see lecture 06!!! and Berlin/Milan talks
     http://www.butterfill.com/talk-slides/milan_2016_core_knowledge/index.html#slide-28)
 (f) object indexes
 (g) object indexes explan permanence
     SIGNATURE LIMITS:
 (g2) object indexes generate predictions about *signature limits*
 (h) object indexes explan causal interactions
 (i) missing part of explanation --- refer back to 
     Charles & Rivera double dissociation (occlusion/endarkening vs v-of-e/search):
     what explains the success/failure in reaching?  Motor representations of affordances!
     Why? Because occlusion breaks affordance, but endarkening doesn’t; also
     McCurry et al 2009 doesn’t necessarily break affordances (because can reach through,
     and note that if object indexes, wouldn’t predict a difference between the conditions)
     (Explan motor representation.)
     NOTE : \citep{moore:2008_factors} show that having the toy make a noise doesn’t help,
     which makes sense since it doesn’t change the affordances!
 (j) another missing part of the explanation --- how do object indexes
     explain not only anticipatory looking but also looking duration?
     Phenomenal expectations / metacognitive feelings ...
 (k) summarise picture: object indexes = core knowledge; motor representations = core knowledge
     (so there are multiple core systems concerning physical objects, one perceptual and 
     one motoric)
     phenomenal expectations (/metacognitive feeling) connect object indexes to 
     looking times
 (l) But how do you get from core knowledge to knowledge?
     phenomenal (/metacognitive feeling) connect object indexes to thought, perhaps via
     tool use, social interactions ...
     SO: development as rediscovery.

      1. How do four-month-old infants  model  physical objects? 
    .notes: :t
      In asking how infants
      model physical objects, we are seeking to understand not how physical objects
      in fact are but how they appear from the point of view of
      an individual or system.
    .notes: :t
      The model need not be thought of as something used by the system: it is
      a tool the theorist uses in describing what the system is for and
      broadly how it works.

  p.center the Simple View
  .notes: :t
    A natuaral answer is the Simple View: #{origins.simple_view}
  .notes: :t
    The Simple View is worth taking seriously for several reasons.
    First, it requires no theoretical or conceptual innovation.
  .notes: :t
    Second, as we saw, the Simple View appears to be quite widely supported by
    developmental psychologists including Baillargeon and, in writings from the
    last millenium, Spelke too.
  .notes: :t
    Third, it can be deduced from the Uncomplicated Account of Minds and Actions.
    That is, the developmental evidence together with
    a background theory about minds and actions which seems implicit in
    much philosophy and perhaps ordinary thinking too
    commits us to the Simple View.

  .notes \section{Conclusion}
  .notes: :t
    To conclude,
    I started by mentioning the wide variety of evidence that 
    four- and five-month-olds can track briefly occluded objects.
    This evidence raises the question, How do infants do that?
    On the leading, best supported hypothesis,
    four- and five-month-olds’ abilities to track briefly occluded objects
    depend on a system of object indexes like that which underpins multiple 
    object tracking or object-specific preview benefits.
    This hypothesis 
    also has the virtue of being consistent with the most straightforward
    explanation of why infants of this age (four- to five-months) and even older
    systematically fail to manually search for occluded objects.
    (The explanation is that they lack beliefs about the locations of objects.)
  .notes: :t
    Accepting this hypothesis forces us to confront a question.
    How could the operations of object indexes explain patterns in looking 
    duration?
    This question arises because 
    facts about the operations of object indexes do not themselves 
    straightforwardly imply anything about how things seem to infants, nor about
    what they believe.
  .notes: :t
    The answer, I suggested, is phenomenal expectations.
    Much as there are phenomenal expectations associated with the ease or 
    difficulty of processing a complex stimulus like a face or letter sequence,
    so also phenomenal expectations are associated with operations involving 
    object indexes.
    These phenomenal expectations are not intentional relations to 
    the phyiscal objects whose behaviours normally cause them.
    Instead they can be thought of as sensations in roughly Reid’s sense.
    So they are monadic properties of perceptual experiences which carry 
    information about physical objects.
  .notes: :t
    Importantly, phenomenal expectations (like sensations) require 
    interpretation.
    In order to get from a phenomenal expectation to a belief you need to 
    form a view about what the phenomenal expectation is a sign of.
    This requires learning, and your view can change as you learn more.
  .notes: :t
    This has consequences for understanding the emergence in 
    development of knowledge of physical objects.
    Such knowledge is probably a consequence of the (core) system of 
    object indexes, but on the view I have been defending the two can be only 
    indirectly related.
    Having core knowledge of objects is a matter of having a system of object
    indexes.  
    The system can affect what you believe or know about objects only by way
    of phenomenal expectations.
    Gaining knowledge proper requires interpreting the phenomenal expectations,
    and so is in part a matter of rediscovering information already processed
    by your core systems.

    This amazing discovery is going to take us a while to fully digest.  As a first step, note its
    significance for Davidson's challenge about characterising what is going on in the head of the 
    child who has a few words, or even no words.
  .notes: :t()
    [*TODO*] \citep{keane:2006_motion} suggests that `If early vision gathers trajectory 
    information, that information cannot reliably be utilized to extrapolate in MOT.'  If this is
    right, either object files aren't FINSTs and the link between object files and multiple-object
    tracking (MOT) is wrong; or else the claim on this slide identifying principles of object
    perception and object indexes is wrong!

  +davidson_inbetween
  .notes: :t()
    The discovery that the principles of object perception characterise the operation of 
    object-indexes doesn't mean we have met the challenge exactly.
    We haven't found a way of describing the processes and representations that underpin infants'
    abilities to deal with objects and causes.
    However, we have reduced the problem of doing this to the problem of characterising how 
    some perceptual mechanisms work.  
    And this shows, importantly, that understanding infants' minds is not something different from
    understanding adults' minds, contrary to what Davidson assumes.
    The problem is not that their cognition is half-formed or in an intermediate state.
    The problem is just that understanding perception requires science and not just intuition.

    Let me make some more points about it.
  .notes: :t()
    First, it doesn't fully answer our question about the relation between the Principles of Object
    Perception and mechanisms in infants.  
    It tells us that the Principles characterise a certain kind of perceptual process.
    This is progress; but we can still ask about the nature of the procesess and representations 
    involved.  This will become important when we consider knowledge in other domains.
  .notes: :t()
    Second, we haven't fully explained the discrepancy between looking and action-based measures for 
    representing objects as persisting and tracking their causal interactions.
    After all, why do these perceptual representations of objects--the object indexes--not guide 
    purposive actions like reaching and pulling?
    This is an issue we shall return to. 
  .notes: :t()
    Third, it leaves us with a question we didn't have before.
    What is the relation between these abilities to segment objects, represent them as persisting 
    and track their causal interactions and knowledge about objects?
    Clearly having an object-index stuck to an object is not the same thing as having knowledge
    about the object's location and movements.  (If it were, we'd face just the problems that are 
    fatal for the Simple View.)
    What then is the relation between these things?
  .notes: :t()
    This third point is related to an issue about the relation between infant and adult capacities,
    one that  I raised at the start of this lecture ...

    What is the relation between infants' competencies with objects and adults'?
    Is it that infants' competencies grow into more sophisticated adult competencies?

  .notes: :t()
    The identification of the Principles of Object Perception with object-indexes suggests that 
    infants' abilities are constant throughout development.
    They do not become adult conceptual abilities; rather they remain as perceptual systems
    that somehow underlie later-developing abilities to acquire knowledge.
  .notes: :t()
    Confirmation for this view comes from considering that there are discrepancies in adults' 
    performances which resemble the discrepancies in infants between looking and action-based

    Phenomenal expectations have been quite widely neglected in philosophy and
    developmental psychology.
    They are a means by which cognitive processes enable perceivers to

    non-conscious cognitive processes and conscious reasoning.
