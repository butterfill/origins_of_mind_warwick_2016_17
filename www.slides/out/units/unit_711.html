  <div class="notes">So we have this model of action, 
where the relation between an action and a goal exists in virtue of an intention 
which represents the goal, coordinates the action, and coordinates the action in such a way
that, normally, the existence of the action increases the probability that the outcome will 
occur.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">Our question is whether this is infants' model of action.
To answer this question we need first to understand more about the model.
In particular we need to know ...

  <div class="notes">[*new route: for the purposes of understanding these agents, we want the simplest possible notion of intention; so we'll take intention as an action-causing belief-desire pair.</div>
  <div class="notes">The idea I want to consider is, surprisingly, that there are no such things as intentions.</div>

  <div class="notes handout"> `The expression `the intention with which James went to church' has the outward form of a description, but in fact it</div>
  <div class="notes handout">...\ % is syncategorematic and </div>
  <div class="notes handout">cannot be taken to refer to an entity, state, disposition, or event. Its function in context is to generate new descriptions of actions in terms of their reasons; thus `James went to church with the intention of pleasing his mother' yields a new, and fuller, description of the action described in `James went to church'.' </div>
  <div class="notes handout ctd">\citep[p.\ 690]{davidson:1963_orig}</div>
  <div class="notes">\end{quote}</div>
  <div class="notes">What motivates this view?</div>
  <div class="notes">We already have beliefs and desires in our model of action explanation.</div>
  <div class="notes">Introducing intentions as additional mental states would make the model more complicated.</div>
  <div class="notes">So if we can do without intentions, we should do so in the interests of simplicity.</div>
</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture05_10.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">But how can we do without intentions?</div>
  <div class="notes">Haven't we just seen that we need intentions in order to explain the relation between an action and the goal or goals to which it is directed?</div>
</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture05_11.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">Here's how Davidson's view works.</div>
  <div class="notes">James desired to please his mother.</div>
  <div class="notes">James believed that going to church would please his mother.</div>
  <div class="notes">And this belief and desire caused his going to church.</div>
  <div class="notes">So the belief--desire pair can play the role of an intention.  </div>
  <div class="notes">It (1) represents an outcome---in this case, the pleasing of James' mother---, (2) causes an event---James' going to church---; and (3) causes an event whose occurrence would normally lead to the outcome’s occurrence.</div>
</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture05_12.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">It appears, then, that we can explain the relation between an action and the goal or goals to which it is directed just in terms of belief and desire.</div>
  <div class="notes">We don't need to introduce intentions as further mental states.</div>
  <div class="notes">If we like we can say that an intention just is a suitable, action-causing belief-desire pair.</div>
  <div class="notes">This view of intention is parallel to a view about knowledge.</div>
  <div class="notes">Some suppose that knowledge is justified true belief.  </div>
  <div class="notes">Or belief meeting some condition like being true and justified.</div>
  <div class="notes">On this sort of view, knowledge is not a mental state over and above belief.</div>
  <div class="notes">Rather, there are just beliefs and some of these beliefs have a special status.</div>
  <div class="notes">Similarly, Davidson's idea might be put by saying that intentions are just action-causing belief--desire pairs.</div>
  <div class="notes">(This is not to say that \emph{any} belief--desire pair is an intention, of course.)</div>

        <div class="notes">Let me give you one more example.</div>
        <div class="notes">Let's assume that we know what beliefs and desires are.</div>
        <div class="notes">It's a familiar idea that they combine to cause actions like this:</div>
        <p>Belief: that if I don’t comb my hair I will get rabies.</p>
        <p class="em-above">Desire: that I don’t get rabies.</p>
        <p class="em-above slide">Baldric combed his hair with <span class="the-intention">the intention</span><span> of avoiding rabies.</span></p>
        <div data-what=" .the-intention" data-class="bkg-words-highlight-invert" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">To say that he had the intention to avoid rabies is, on this view, just to say that his action was caused by a belief and a desire with these contents.</div>

  <div class="notes">Now this isn't the right way to model adults' understanding of intention, but it's an approximation that works in the cases we're concerned with.</div>

  <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
  <div class="notes">Reason (a): understanding intention is not something potentially less sophisticated than 
understanding belief; on the contrary, even the simplest way of understanding intention
presupposes understanding belief (and desire).
So unless we think infants have a sophisticated understanding of mental states, we shouldn't 
suppose that their model of action includes intention.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">Reason (b) Minimal theory of mind ... presupposes an understanding of goal-directed action.
If we explain goal-directed action in terms of intention, we are thereby sneaking
beliefs and desire in through the back door.  So the whole minimal theory of mind project would
fail.
(You might say, on minimal theory of mind that instead of beliefs and desires we could combine 
registration and preference; but that would affect the construction since registration was 
explained in terms of goal-directed action).
  </div>
  <div class="notes">Reason (c): Mere curiosity. It would be good to see if there is any other, perhaps simpler way 
of understanding this relation, perhaps one that doesn't involve insight into mental states.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">So, is there a simpler model of the relation, one that infants might understand?</div>
