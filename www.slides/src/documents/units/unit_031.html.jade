        I love this: Davidson says we will fail.  So encouraging.
        But why will we fail?

        Is he suggesting the issue is merely terminological?  Not quite ...

    Why suppose there is any role for philosophers rather than scientists?
    Part of the answer is provided by Donald Davidson.
  .notes: :t()
    The question is how humans come to know about objects, words, thoughts and other things.
    In pursuing this question we have to consider minds where the knowledge is neither clearly 
    present nor obviously absent. 
    This is challenging because both commonsense and theoretical tools for describing minds are 
    generally designed for characterising fully developed adults.

      So this is the challenge.  We are describing something which is neither mindless 
      nor involving full-blown thought and action.  And, as Davidson observes, we lack
      a way of describing what is in between.
    .notes: :t()
      Earlier I asked why philosophers rather than only scientists should investigate the 
      question about the origins of mind.  And this is the answer.  It's because tacking
      with the quesiton will require new conceptual tools.

      This challenge is one that we will face again and again.
