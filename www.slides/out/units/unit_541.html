You're sitting here and everyone else is concentrating or making notes and obviously getting something out of being here that you aren't.  But what?  What is it that they are doing and how are they doing it?  </div>
          <div class="notes">Some deaf children in North America are brought up in purely oral environments without any sign language and therefore don't experience language at all.  These children invent their own sign languages, which are called homesigns.  Their invented languages are not as rich as those of children who experience other people's languages, but they have many of the same features (Goldin-Meadow 2002, 2003).  These deaf children have somehow worked out for themselves what linguistic communication is and they have found a way of doing it.  They have invented languages with no prior experience of language, and they have invented languages in a modality that people around them barely use in linguistic communication.  These linguistically isolated deaf children have answered in practice the questions that these lectures are about.</div>

David points at the chair at the head of the dining room table in his home and then produces a “sleep” gesture to tell us that his father (who typically sits in that chair) is asleep in another room.

Although this gesture looks like it should be used only to describe snapping long thin objects into two pieces with the hands, all of the children used the gesture to refer to objects of a variety of sizes and shapes, many of which had not been broken by the hands.  In panel B, Marvin is shown producing a “give” gesture.  This gesture looks like it should mean “put something small in my hand,” but all of the children used it to request the transfer of an object, big or small, to a place that was not necessarily the child's hand.  Thus, many of the gestures that the deaf children used were not as transparent in meaning as a quick glance would suggest” (Goldin-Meadow 2003: 76, figure 2).</div><img src="/img/goldin-meadow_2003_fig2.png"/>

She crooks her index finger and holds it in the air (this is an emblem in Taiwan that hearing speakers use to mean dead).

McNeill, 1992). But that’s not what the deaf children do.  They develop a stable store of forms which they use in a range of situations-they develop a lexicon, an essential component of all languages (Goldin-Meadow, Butcher, Mylander, & Dodge, 1994).’ \citep[p.\ 1389]{Goldin-Meadow:2002dq}</div>
