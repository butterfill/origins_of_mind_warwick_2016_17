My question is: How do humans first acquire knowledge of particular causal

I want to approach this question in an odd way, by thinking about the perception of causation
in adults.
But before I come to that, I also want to mention that there is a second theme for this lecture.

        <div class="notes">In this lecture I want to consider several interlocking themes simultaneously.
The second theme is the Problem I introduced in the last lecture, which arises from
the failure of the Simple View.
The Problem is to understand the relation between infants' abilities regarding physical objects
and the Spelke principles which describe these given that the principles and their deliverances
are not actually knowledge.
It turns out that thinking about the perception of causation will help us with this theme too.

let me start by giving you a very recap.
What is the Simple View, why does it fail and why is its failure a problem?

reaching behaviours.

        <div class="notes">This problem arises twice, once for object permanence and again for causal interactions.
Take object permanence first.  In this case the problem is 
that four and five month old infants appear to be surprised when a solid object is placed 
behind a drawbridge 
and then the drawbridge rotates back 180 degrees as if the object wasn't there.  
But if you put a desirable object behind a screen, these infants won't ever search behind the 
screen for the object. 
So if we measure their looking behaviours, they seem to know that an object is behind the 
screen; but if we measure their searching behaviours they seem not to know this.

        <div class="notes">As I keep saying, 
the problem for the Simple View is that it correctly predicts looking behaviours but not 
searching behaviours.
This problem arises a second time in the case of infants' abilities to track causal 
interactions.
Suppose you roll a ball down this ramp and remove it from behind one of the doors.
You can predict where the ball will stop because you can see this barrier sticking up here.
2 and 2.5 year olds will look longer if you remove it from any door other than the right one.
These children and infants can also predict the location of the object (not just identify a 
violation, but look forward to where the object is) \citep{mash:2006_what}.
But if you ask them to remove the ball (and offer them a reward for doing so), 
the two year olds will typically choose a favourite door to open every time regardless of where 
the barrier is.  
(Incidentally this is not random but seems to be based on momentum 
\citep{perry:2008_representational}.) 
And the 2.5 year olds will choose a door adjacent to the barrier but do not prefer the door on 
the correct side of the barrier.

        <div class="notes">The failure to reach is a problem for the Simple View because it predicts that children will 
correctly retrieve the ball.

but they do represent them.  This move involves making some assumptions, but I think it is a 
good move as far as it goes.
The problem is that it doesn't go very far.
Representation is a highly abstract notion. 
Knowledge and belief are types of representation, and there are many other kinds.
In order to make predictions, we need to say what kind of representation underpins
infants' competence.

It doesn't arise only in the case of knowledge of objects but also in other domains (like knowledge of number and knowledge of mind).
And it doesn't arise only from evidence about infants or nonhuman primates; it would also arise if our focus were exclusively on human adults.
More on this later.

          <div class="notes">Why is this important?
The discovery of infant abilities presents us with a dilemma.
If we follow researchers like Michael Tomasello in dismissing infants' abilities to focus on 
social interactions, culture and language, we miss something important about the origins of 
knowledge.  We will miss the fact that coming to know things about physical objects (and 
colours, and mind and more besides) involves multiple layers of representation.
But if we follow researchers like Spelke and Baillargeon is discussing infants' abilities as 
if they were based on knowledge, belief and inference, we will also miss something important 
about the origins of knowledge.  We will miss the fact that infants' abilities, although 
essential for later developments, are only indirectly related to the knowledge of physical 
objects that adult humans enjoy.
The challenge is to avoid this dilemma, to provide a theoretical framework that will allow us 
to understand how infants' abilities support the emergence of knowledge without themselves 
amounting to knowledge.

        <div class="notes handout">Infants at around six months of age seem also to distinguish launching from other sequences, 
much as adults do \citep{Leslie:1987nr}.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">[nb: Several people have discussed this in seminars so I won't discuss it here (the reference is on your handout).]
        </div>
        <div class="notes">In their experiment, they compared two groups of infants.
The first group was habituated to the top display, which is just the sort of animation Michotte
used to get reports of causal experiences in adults.
After habituation, this first group was then shown the same display except that the direction was 
reversed.
Meanwhile a second group was habituated to a display like the top display here except 
that there was a delay between the first object stopping and the second object starting.
This delay would mean that, in adults, there are no reports of experiences of a causal interaction.
After habituation, this second group was shown the same display except that the direction of 
movement was reversed.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Of interest was whether the first group showed greater dishabituation to the reversal than 
the second group.
How could this tell us anything about infants' experiences?
Suppose that infants do not have anything like what adults report as an experience of causation.
They they experience merely patterns of movement.
And, in this case, reversing on sequence should create no more interest than reversing the other.
But now suppose that infants do have something like what adults report as an experience 
of causation?
Then, when reversing the first sequence, there are two changes: there is a change both to the 
movement and to the character of the causal interaction.  To put it informally,
reversing direction means that the patient of the interaction becomes its agent.
So the hypothesis that infants' experiences of Michotte-like stimuli resemble adults 
predicts that there will be greater dishabituation when the first, `direct launching` sequence 
is reversed.

As I said,
normally, if the two balls overlap completely, subjects report seeing a single object 
changing colour.
But if we show subjects a sequence like the launching effect but where the first square 
overlaps the second's position before it moves.  When this event is shown is isolation 
almost all subjects see it as a single object changing colour.  But when the event is 
shown with an 
unambiguous launching effect nearby, almost all subjects now see the 'overlap' event as 
a launching.
Causal capture means that we can show subjects a sequence with complete overlap and 
still have the report a causal effect.

See \citep[p.\ 59]{scholl:2009_what}:
`I suggest that what Pylyshyn’s (2004) experiments show is exactly what they intuitively 
seem to show: We can keep track of the targets in MOT, but not which one is which. 
This undercuts any reason to suggest that data-driven index maintenance is playing any 
role in MOT, though, since the only way to modify the functioning of indexes to match 
these results would be to strip them of the one property they must have in order to 
fulfill the purpose for which they are theorized to exist in the first place. But again, 
all of this seems easily explained—and perhaps even necessarily predicted—by the view 
that MOT is simply realized by split object-based attention to the MOT targets as a set.'

However, \citep{horowitz:2010_direction} show that, in a MOT paradigm, observers 
can report the direction of one or two targets without advance knowledge of which 
targets' directions they will be asked to report.

understand.  But the point that having object indexes involves tracking causal interactions
is less straightforward.  So let's consider that ...

In order to track objects, a perceptual system has to be sensitive to be causal interactions
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Why is this true?
Because when you have a causal interaction, there's a conflict between principles of object 
perception e.g. distinct surfaces=>two objects, vs good continuity of motion=>one object
The perceptual system needs to know when conflicts should be reconciled and when they should 
be written off.
We get perceptual effects of causal interactions when there are conflicts among cues of object 
identity.

        <div class="notes">This is a point Michotte made.  He found that launching occurs when there is a conflict between 
cues to object identity: good continuity of movement suggests a single object whereas the 
existence of two distinct surfaces indicates two objects.

Ingeniously, Michotte compares launching with the movement of a single object. The single 
object moves half way across a screen then pauses before continuing to move. Michotte found 
that the longest pause between the two movements consistent with subjects experiencing them 
as a single movement is around 80ms, exactly the longest pause consistent with experiences 
characteristic of launching \citep[pp.\ 91--8, 124]{Michotte:1946nz}. Accordingly, the 
experience characteristic of launching appears to require that the two movements be 
experienced as uninterrupted—--this is why they can be separated by a pause of up to but 
no longer than 80ms.

kinds of causal interaction in order to reconcile conflicting cues to object identity.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">In slightly more detail: one function of our perceptual systems is to identify and track 
objects; this is done by means of various cues; sometimes the visual system is faced with 
conflicting cues to object identity which need to be resolved in order to arrive at a 
satisfactory interpretation; when certain types of causal interaction occur there is a 
conflict among cues to object identity; these conflicts must be treated differently from other 
conflicts because they do not indicate failures of object identification and so do not  
require resolution or further perceptual processing. 
So object perception depends on sensitivity to certain types of causal interaction and this is 
why the launching effect occurs.

return to the topic of objects and the problem we encountered in the last lecture.

          <div class="notes">When we asked how infants meet these three requirements, we found that a single set of principles,
the Principles of Object Perception, seemed to underlie all three abilities.

Recall that the \emph{simple view} is the view that the principles of object perception are things that we know or believe, and we generate expectations from these principles by a process of inference..

We know it is wrong because it makes systematically incorrect predictions about infants' actions.
These arise from a discrepancy between measures that involve looking times or eye movements
and measures that involve 
other kinds of action, such as searching and pulling.

        <div class="notes">The discovery that the principles of object perception characterise the operation of 
object-indexes doesn't mean we have met the challenge exactly.
We haven't found a way of describing the processes and representations that underpin infants'
abilities to deal with objects and causes.
However, we have reduced the problem of doing this to the problem of characterising how 
some perceptual mechanisms work.  
And this shows, importantly, that understanding infants' minds is not something different from
understanding adults' minds, contrary to what Davidson assumes.
The problem is not that their cognition is half-formed or in an intermediate state.
The problem is just that understanding perception requires science and not just intuition.

          </div>
          <div class="notes">First, it doesn't fully answer our question about the relation between the Principles of Object
Perception and mechanisms in infants.  
It tells us that the Principles characterise a certain kind of perceptual process.
This is progress; but we can still ask about the nature of the procesess and representations 
involved.  This will become important when we consider knowledge in other domains.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Second, we haven't fully explained the discrepancy between looking and action-based measures for 
representing objects as persisting and tracking their causal interactions.
After all, why do these perceptual representations of objects--the object indexes--not guide 
purposive actions like reaching and pulling?
This is an issue we shall return to.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Third, it leaves us with a question we didn't have before.
What is the relation between these abilities to segment objects, represent them as persisting 
and track their causal interactions and knowledge about objects?
Clearly having an object-index stuck to an object is not the same thing as having knowledge
about the object's location and movements.  (If it were, we'd face just the problems that are 
fatal for the Simple View.)
What then is the relation between these things?

          <div class="notes">This third point is related to an issue about the relation between infant and adult capacities,
one that  I raised at the start of this lecture ...

No, because perceptual expectations are judgement-independent.

(ii) adults.  ('both physics experts and novices possess the same set of implicit beliefs about 
motion.' \citep[p.\ 451]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus})
--- limits of infants' systems found in adults shows that we can identify the system as 
persisting 
--- note that other studies also show judgement-independence, but in the other way (implicit 
knowledge of physical interactions more accurate than judgement: 'a number of previous studies 
suggesting a dissociation between explicit and implicit knowledge of the principles of physics. 
For instance, Hubbard suggests that implicit knowledge reflects internalization of invariant 
physical principles, whereas explicit knowledge about motion may be less accurate. Similarly, 
Krist et al. (1993) suggested that perceptually based knowledge is more accurate than verbal 
concepts of motion.' \citep[p.\ 450]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus}
--- What questions does this bear on?  (1) perceptual & modular nature of infants' 
understanding of objects and their interactions; (2) relation between infant competence and 
adults' (do the thing about system being transformed or discarded versus two systems persisting 
through development : this is different from issues about innateness, which looks from 
infants' competence backwards --- here we go in the other direction, looking forwards); and 
(3) trade-offs between flexibility and efficiency (see below; worth talking about this in some 
detail here)
--- on cognitive efficiency:  	`To extrapolate objects’ motion on the basis of physical 
principles, one should have assessed and evaluated the presence and magnitude of such 
imperceptible forces as friction and air resistance operating in the real world.  This would 
require a time-consuming analysis that is not always possible. In order to have a survival 
advantage, the process of extrapolation should be fast and effortless, without much conscious 
deliberation. Impetus theory allows us to extrapolate objects’ motion quickly and without large 
demands on attentional resources.' \citep[p.\ 450]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus}
**caution (basically fine, but need to be careful): 'The extent to which displacement reflects 
physical principles per se has been widely debated in the literature; theories of displacement 
suggest a variety of potential effects of physical principles ranging from an incorporation of 
the principle of momentum into mental representation (e.g., Finke et al., 1986) to a rejection 
of any internalization of physical principles (e.g., Kerzel, 2000, 2003a). The empirical 
evidence is clear that (1) displacement does not always correspond to predictions based on 
physical principles and (2) variables unrelated to physical principles (e.g., the presence of 
landmarks, target identity, or expectations regarding a change in target direction) can 
influence displacement. ... information based on a naive understanding of physical principles 
or on subjective consequences of physical principles appears to be just one of many types of 
information that could potentially contribute to the displacement of any given target'

          </div>
          <div class="notes">There are two reasons.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">First, the signature limits provide us with a means to identify infant with adult cognition.
If both infants and adults are subjects to the same signature limits, namely those associated
with impetus mechanics, then we can infer that the representations of physical objects in 
adult 's perceptual processes originate from the same source as infants' representations of 
physical objects.

          <div class="notes">Second, it shows that the perceptual expectations involved in the representational momentum
are distinct from judgements.  You would not expect representational momentum to guide 
purposive actions that are separated in time from the perceptual experiences.

measures of abilities to track causal interactions.
While I don't think we are yet in a position to explain these discrepancies, we can identify 
them with discrepancies that are also found in adults.
I suggest that
the discrepancies bewteen perceptual expectations and verbal judgements in adults have the same
source

Their explanation lies in the nature of perceptual expectations.

First, Given that the simple view is wrong, what is the relation between the principles of object perception and infants’ competence in segmenting objects, object permanence and tracking causal interactions?
These principles describe the operation of a module whose function concerns objects.
The principles describe the operations of the system of object indexes.
(So the principles are not necessarily represented at all.)

        <div class="notes">Second, and relatedly, The principles of object perception result in ‘expectations’ in infants.  What is the nature of these expectations?
The expectations are perceptual expectations and the result of modular, computational processes.
The expectations are neither knowledge nor perceptions.
They are rather representations internal to the system of object indexes.
(This is why we get the two discrepancies between spontaneous looking and purposive actions 
like searching.)

  <div class="notes">Concerning knowledge of causal interactions, what have we learnt?
Infants, like adults, have perceptual systems that enable them to detect some kinds of 
causal interaction.
Now this does not mean, I think, that they have knowledge of particular causal interactions.
To attribute them such knowledge would conflict with their failures to act.
(Link this to the Hood et al experiment, intially presented as about permanence:
*TODO* **add three slides**: spelke ball drop, hood et al, leslie and keeble --- I want to
say these three all have a common explanation, namely perceptual mechanisms.)

track some kinds of causal interaction should be undestood not by attributing 
them knowledge of causal interaction but by rather identifying perceptual processes that 
function to track certain kinds of causal interactions among objects.
This is a step forwards insofar as it solves the Problem  (at least partially).
But our overall question is about knowledge not representation.
What we really want to know is, How do humans go from not having any knowledge of 
causal interactions involving particular objects to having some such knowledge?

We've said that infants' competence with causes and objects is not knowledge but something 
more primitive than knowledge, something which exists in adults too and can carry information

So, if at all, how does appealing to these early capacities enable us to explain the origins

        <div class="notes">Broadly, my suggestion will be that the competence which appears in the first months of 
development leads to knowledge of objects and causes only in conjunction with various
additional things, like social interaction, perhaps language and abilities to use tools.

primitive that concepts or thoughts and do not appear to have any kind of social origin.

Basic forms of tool use may not require understanding how objects interact 
(Barrett, Davis, & Needham; Lockman, 2000), and may depend on core cognition of 
contact-mechanics (Goldenberg & Hagmann, 1998; Johnson-Frey, 2004). 
Experience of tool use may in turn assist children in understanding notions of manipulation, 
a key causal notion (Menzies & Price, 1993; Woodward, 2003). Perhaps non-core capacities for 
causal representation are not innate but originate with experiences of tool use.

We have introduced it by providing a list of features.
But why suppose that this particular list of features constitutes a natural kind?
This worry has been brought into sharp focus by criticisms of 'two systems' approaches.

          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The Core Knowledge View is the view that infants' competence with objects, causes, colours
and the rest depends not on knowledge (as the Simple View has it) but on core knowledge.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the first question, I could tell you a long story about computational processes and 
representational formats.  But I won't do that here.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the second question, I think the answer is probably yes because the difference in
representational formats between knowledge proper and core knowledge explains limited
accessibility, and this in turn partially explains the discrepancies.
(But note that it doesn't explain is why the discrepacies fall exactly where they do.)
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the third question, I think that thinking about categorical perception, or the perceptual 
systems that underpin objects indexes is a way of getting at what core knowledge really 
involves.  Core systems are not always something over and above perceptual and motor systems
(although it seems probably that they sometimes are if our competence with syntax rests on 
core knowledge).
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the fourth question,
Most people are committed to there being different stories for (a) colour (categorical 
perception); (b) syntax (tacit knowledge); and (c) physical objects.
I'm not sure. I'm tempted to think that perceptual and motor cognition are at the root of these 
in every case, but this is a radical idea for which there is currenly very little evidence.

        <div class="notes">The fifth question is just a variant of what I called The Problem (see lecture 2; it arises 
from the failure of the Simple View).
