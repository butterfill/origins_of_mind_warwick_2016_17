  There is an obstacle to understanding the emergence of knowledge in development.
  As Davidson (1999, 11) puts it,
  ‘We have many vocabularies for describing nature when we regard it as 
  mindless
  and we have a mentalistic vocabulary for describing 
  thought and intentional action
  what we lack is a way of describing 
  what is in between’

    Why suppose there is any role for philosophers rather than scientists?
    Part of the answer is provided by Donald Davidson.
  .notes: :t
    The question is how humans come to know about objects, words, thoughts and other things.
    In pursuing this question we have to consider minds where the knowledge is neither clearly 
    present nor obviously absent. 
    This is challenging because both commonsense and theoretical tools for describing minds are 
    generally designed for characterising fully developed adults.

    .notes: :t
      So this is the challenge.  We are describing something which is neither mindless 
      nor involving full-blown thought and action.  And, as Davidson observes, we lack
      a way of describing what is in between.
    .notes: :t
      The question about the origins of mind is in part a philosophical question because
      answering it will require new conceptual tools.
    .notes: :t
      This challenge is one that we will face again and again.

    What does Davidson have in mind?  Let me introduce 
    what I’ll call the ‘Uncomplicated Account of Minds and Actions’.
  +UncomplicatedAccountOfMindsAndActions({handout:true, notes:true})
  .slide
    +show('.theAccount')
  .slide
    +show('.generalise')
  .slide
    +invert('.believes')
    .notes: :t
      The Uncomplicated Account could be elaborated to take into account
      the fact that how people act depends on attitudes other than belief.
      For example, much may depend on whether Wy likes, or fears, spiders.
    .notes: :t
      Philosophers have done much of this elaboration, building on the Uncomplicated
      Account by identifying features of belief adding attitudes like desire
      and intention as well as fear and pride.  
  .slide
    +uninvert('.believes')
    .notes: :t
      But there is a fundamental problem with the Uncomplicated Account,
      one that probably can’t be fixed by elaborating it with further attitudes.
      The problem is that, as we will see in a moment, there are cases in which
      (2) turns out to be wrong and the connection between (1) and (2) breaks down.
    .notes: :t
      If we want to understand what is going on in the head of an infant who is 
      in the process of developing capacities for knowledge, we will have to
      fundamentally revise the Uncomplicated Account.
