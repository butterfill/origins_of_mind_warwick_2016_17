Sometime later we do know some things.
How does the transition occur?
  </div>
  <div class="notes">We are going to approach this question by examining the evidence from developmental science, 
exploring how it bears on philosophical positions like nativism and empiricsm, 
and identifying philosophical problems created by the evidence.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">But first let me try to reassure you that it's ok for a course in philosophy to focus on 
this question.
Far from being a new question, it belongs to a family of questions about the origins of mind 
that philosophers have been asking since Plato or before.

        <div class="notes">Note that whereas Locke puts the question in terms of Ideas, Fodor, writing much later,
asks about propositional attitudes, that is, about states such as knowlegde and belief.
This difference need not concern us; we now have a much better understanding of the metaphysics

        <div class="notes">Because he focusses on behaviour and mental operations rather than Ideas or states of mind,
he puts the question in terms of a transition from unthinking ('organic') behaviour 
to capacities for observational and conceptual operations.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">So my question about how we first come to know things in various domains is an ok question
for a philosopher to ask because it belongs to a family of questions that philosophers who 
have been dead for a long time were asking.

        <div class="notes">One last thing.
Fodor mentions cognitive psychologists rather than philosophers.  We will need to face up to 
the question of why philosophers are asking this question about the origins of knowledge, why 
is isn't just a scientific question.  I'll come to this shortly.

          <div class="notes">How do humans first come to know  about---and to knowingly manipulate---objects, causes, words, 
numbers, colours, actions and minds?
In a beautiful myth, Plato (who also asked this question) suggests that the answer is 
recollection. 
Before we are born, in another world, we become acquainted with the truth. 
Then, in falling to earth, we forget everything. 
But as we grow we are sometimes able to recall part of what we once knew.
So it is by recollection that humans come to know about objects, causes, numbers and everything 
else.

<section class="slide">
  <div class="notes">Why suppose there is any role for philosophers rather than scientists?
Part of the answer is provided by Donald Davidson.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">The question is how humans come to know about objects, words, thoughts and other things.
In pursuing this question we have to consider minds where the knowledge is neither clearly 
present nor obviously absent. 
This is challenging because both commonsense and theoretical tools for describing minds are 
generally designed for characterising fully developed adults.

As we will see, how we first come to know things about colours, say, isn't quite the same

But there is one very general point we can make: in all these domains, we will face 
Davidson's challenge, the challenge of explaining what is inbetween mindless behaviour

        <div class="notes">A famous study by Renee Baillargeon and her collaborators provides evidence that humans can 
represent unperceived objects from around four months of age or earlier.  
This is called the 'drawbridge study'
        </div>
        <div class="notes">What you are about to see are the test events from Experiment 1 of Baillargeon et al's 
1987 study.  You're looking at them from the side whereas the subjects, four-month olds,
were looking at them from the front (which is to your right).
        </div>
        <div class="notes">In showing you these test events,
I need to explain the method used in this experiment, \emph{habituation}; 
this is a method we will encounter repeatedly so it's good to understand how it is 
supposed to work.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">%glossary: habituation</div>
        <div class="notes">What you see here is a barrier rotating through 180 degrees.
Infants were habituated to this; that is, they were shown it repeatedly until it no longer 
held their interest.
The first time they're shown this, they might spend 60 seconds looking at it, which is a long
time for an infant; but after, say, five demonstrations, they'd only be looking at it for 
around 10 seconds.  That is, they are habituated to this display.

        <div class="notes">Now there is a very small change to the display.
The display is just as before, except for before the drawbridge moves an object is placed 
behind it.
There are then two different things that could happen.  One is that the drawbridge moves 
exactly as before, rotating a full 180 degrees.  This is called the 'impossible event'.
The other is that the drawbridge now rotates for 120 degrees, which is the 'possible event'.
In no case is the object visible after the drawbridge has started moving.
We want to know which events infants find more novel.
If they are unable to know facts about  the locations of unperceived objects, then they should 
find the
'possible event' more novel than the 'impossible event' because it is more different
from the event they have been habituated to.
On the other hand, if infants are able know facts about the locations of unperceived objects,
they should find the impossible event more novel than the possible event because, well,
it's impossible.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">To find out what infants find more interesting, they are divided into two groups.  
One group sees the impossible event, the other the possible event.
The experimenters measure how long the infants look at these events, which is the measure of 
their dishabituation.  The background assumptions are that looking longer indicates more 
interest, and that interest is driven by novelty.

First, were infants more likely to pull the screen forwards when an object was placed behind it?

Since infants wanted the toy, if they knew it was behind the barrier they should have pulled
forward the barrier more often when the toy was behind it.
This is exactly what they did when the barrier was transparent.
But look what happens when the barrier is opaque, so that the toy is not visible to infants 
when they have to prepare the pulling action: they no longer pull the barrier more often
when the toy was behind it.

          <div class="notes">You might be wondering whether there's a philosophical problem here.
Science is a messy business and you get conflicting results all the time.
But this particular pattern of conflicting results is extremely interesting philosophically.
It shows that we cannot say that, at, say, five months of age, infants know facts about the 
locations
of particular unperceived objects.  
We cannot say this because doing so generates predictions which are clearly false (predictions
about where they will search for an unperceived object).
But it also shows that we cannot say that they have no sense at all concerning facts about the 
locations of particular unperceived objects.  We cannot say this because of the
competence they manifest in distinguishing possible from impossible events.

something inbetween knowledge and its absence, something that is like knowledge in some 
respects but falls short of it in others.

It should be an open question for us whether what underpins infants' abilities to distinguish
possible from impossible events is really a kind knowledge or something else.

          </div>
          <div class="notes">I mention this quote just to show you that we have a problem which is partly philosophical
and partly scientific.  
The scientific part involves identifying distinct systems of representation and understanding
their development.
The philosophical part is to make sense of the idea that there can
be different kinds of knowledge, or things that are like knowledge but not knowledge, and
to explore how different kinds of knowledge are related.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">[*aside: move]
At this point you might object.  The question is about knowledge.  
But does either searching or distinguishing really provide evidence of knowing?
You might insist that neithermanifest knowledge in infants.
It is a good question whether searching or distinguishing manifests knowledge.
For now I just want to note that if you think neither is, then Davidson's challenge becomes 
even more pressing -- more pressing because we now need two distinct kinds of state which
are like knowledge in some respects but not in others, not just one!
It's perhaps also worth mentioning that whether or not the things manifested in searching and 
distinguishing are knowledge proper, they are surely things that matter for explaining how 
knowledge is eventually acquired.

to knowingly manipulate--objects, causes, words, numbers, colours, actions and minds?

          <div class="notes">But then you might wonder, What philosophical questions arise here?  Isn't this a narrowly

The answer is no because thinking about how humans come to know things requires us to meet 
Davidson's challenge, to understand things that are neither mindless nor thought or knowledge 
but somewhere in between.
As Hood suggests in the quote I just showed you, this might involve rethinking what knowledge

          <div class="notes">I hope I've given you a flavour of the approach we're going to take.
Good philosophy of mind has always been driven by scientific findings about the mind.
John Locke, David Hume as well as more recent philosophers like Jerry Fodor and Andy Clark all 
start with a deep understanding of the science of the mind.
But there is a difference.
Fodor and many other contemporary philosophers are working on the big picture, trying to make 
explicit general features of the conceptual framework which scientists have more or less 
implicitly adopted.
They are also often intrested in questions about the foundations of psychology itself.
By contrast, what I want us to do in this course is to look at specific problems that arise 
from the evidence,
and to provide philosophical tools for tackling this problem.
So you might say that whereas others are trying to be the architect, we're trying more 
modestly to build the tools.
This might sound too modest to be interesting.
You'd probably prefer to be the architect whose plans guide the scientists rather than the

But, as we'll see, it turns out that attention to the details will give us new perspectives on 
some key philosophical issues about the nature of knowledge, perception and action.

          <div class="notes">We're going to try to understand how humans come to know about things by examining what 
developmental psychology tells us about the acquisition of knowledge.
This turns out to be a partly philosophical project because understanding the apparently 
conflicting evidence requires us to re-think notions like knowledge and representation.
In practice, this means looking carefully, and in detail, at the scientific evidence.
If you want to know how minds work, you have to start with the evidence.

        <div class="notes">We will see that infants can tackle physics, number, agents and minds thanks to a set of 
innate or early-developing abilities, often labelled `core knowledge'.
        </div>
        <div class="slide nodim">
          <p>We don't understand it.</p>
          <div class="notes">For now, let us use the term `core knowledge' to mean whatever infants have concerning
the locations of particular objects which is not knowledge but which underpins their
abilities to discriminate between phyiscally possible and physically impossible
sitatuions where the difference between possibile and impossibile depends on facts about
objects the infants are not currently perceiving.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">It is important that we don't (yet) know what core knowledge is; `core knowledge' is a 
term of art. I haven't explained what it is.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">[*needs updating!]
Our position is this.
Some scientists talk about core knowledge, and formulate hypotheses in terms of it.
Since these hypotheses are supported by evidence, we can reasonably suppose they are true.
So there are some things we provisionally suppose are truths about core knowledge.
For instance, infants' core knowledge enables them to represent unperceived objects.
So we know some truths about core knowledge, but we don't know what it is.
You'd probably prefer it if I could tell you what core knowledge is first.
But here we have to work backwards.
We have to gather truths about this unknown thing, core knowledge.
And then we have to ask, What could core knowledge be given that these things are true?

unknowable by introspection and judgement-independent; it is specific to quite narrow 
categories of event and does not grow by means of generalization; it is best understood 
as a collection of rules rather than a coherent theory; and it has limited application 
being usually manifest in the control of attention (as measured by dishabituation, gaze, 
and looking times) and rarely or never manifest in purposive actions such as reaching.

              <div class="notes">Perhaps the best evidence how sophisticated infant social interaction can be comes
from studies of language creation. 
(This will be a key topic when we come to study knowledge of language, but let me 
give you a tiny preview.)
              </div>
              <div class="notes">Children with no experience of others' languages can create their own languages.
We know this from studies of profoundly deaf children brought up in purely oral 
environments and therefore without experience of language 
\citep{Kegl:1999es,Senghas:2001zm,Goldin-Meadow:2003pj}.
Individually or in groups these children invent their own signed languages.
These languages are not as rich as those of children with experience of other 
people's languages but they have all of the essential features of language 
including lexicons and syntax (*refs: Goldin-Meadow 2002, 2003).
The children invent gesture forms for words which they use with the same meanings 
in different contexts, they adopt standard orderings for combining words into 
sentences, and they use sentences in constructing narratives about past, present, 
future and hypothetical events (*ref: Goldin-Meadow 2003: 170).
              </div>
              <div class="notes">But it is not just children in extreme circumstances that create words.
Children in ordinary environments will create their own words before they learn to 
use those of the adults; when children start speaking, it is often the adults who 
are learning new words.
(‘Some children are so impatient that they coin their own demonstrative pronoun.  For 
instance, at the age of about 12 months, Max would point to different objects and 
say “doh?,” sometimes with the intent that we do something with the objects, such as 
bring them to him, and sometimes just wanting us to appreciate their existence’
(\citealp[p.\ 122]{Bloom:2000qz}; see further \citealp{Clark:1981bi,Clark:1982hj}).)
              </div>
              <div class="notes">And even where children have mastered a lexical convention, they will readily violate 
it in their own utterances in order to get a point across.
(‘From the time they first use words until they are about two or two-and-a-half, 
children noticeably and systematically overextend words.  For example, one child used 
the word “apple” to refer to balls of soap, a rubber-ball, a ball-lamp, a tomato, 
cherries, peaches, strawberries, an orange, a pear, an onion, and round biscuits’

          <p class="center">development as rediscovery</p>
          <div class="notes">The idea, in essence, is that cognitive development is a kind of rediscovery.
(But not exactly as Plato's myth had it.)
          </div>
          <div class="notes">How do humans get from core knowledge to knowledge knowledge?
I want to suggest that it involves a process of rediscovery.
I don't think it's a case of partial knowledge becoming gradually more complete, or of
the core knowledge providing content for later knowledge states.
Rather, I think the core knowledge shapes the  
subject's body, behaviour and attention in ways that facilitate discovery at the next stage.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">And, most importantly, core knowledge enables increasingly sophisticated forms of social 
interaction.
It is these social interactions---together with the bodily, behavioural and mental changes---that 
enable subsequent re-discoveries. 
So, on this view, the role of some early-developing abilities in explaining the later acquisition 
of conceptual understanding does not involve direct representational connections; 
rather the early developing abilities facilitate or enable social interaction, 
influence attention and inform behaviour; 
and these influences facilitate development.

          <div class="notes">To make this vague idea slightly more concrete, let me zoom in. 
I think having verbal labels for things sometimes helps with acquiring concepts of them.
Now this sounds paradoxical. 
Doesn't having a label for something mean being able to label correctly? 
And how could you label correctly without the corresponding concept? 
My suggestion is that having core knowledge is not having a concept (many disagree); 
but core knowledge could underpin your correct use of a label. 
Now labels are acquired through social interaction, or so I suggested earlier. 
Hence the picture.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Now this picture needs two qualifications. 
First, it's missing some details, and these details will vary from case to case 
(what's true of knowledge of objects might not be true of knowledge of number). 
Second, the picture might be completely wrong. 
But even if the picture is wrong, I'll bet that social interaction and core knowledge are both 
essential for explaining how humans come to know things. 
So I don't claim to know how these two are necessary, only that they are. 
In fact my aim isn't primarily to explain to you how these two factors explain the origins of 
mind. 
Instead my hope is this. 
I'll give you the background on social interaction and core knowledge. 
And you'll tell me how these two (or perhaps other factors) are involved in explaining how 
humans come to know things about objects, colours, actions, numbers and the rest.
