          <div class="notes">It is a familiar idea,
from the history of science,
that there are multiple \textbf{theories} of the physical:
impetus and Newtonian mechancs, for example.
The impetus theory says that moving objects have something, impetus, that they gradually loose.
When they loose their impetus they stop moving.
If you push them you impart impetus to them, and that is why they move.
With Newtonian mechanics this is not the case; there is no impetus.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">In limited but common range of cases, impetus and Newtonian mechanics 
coincide.
However, the two theories make different predictions about the acceleration of falling objects,
and of a ascending objects (those launched vertically, in the manner of a rocket).
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Consider ascending objects.  We're fixing density and shape and considering how the size 
of objects changes things.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">According to Newtonian mechanics, if we ignore air resistance, then size makes no difference to
accelleration.  If we include air resistance, larger objects accellerate faster (because of the 
difference in ratio of mass to surface).
          </div>
          <div class="notes">By contrast, according to an impetus principle:
‘More massive objects accelerate at a slower rate. An object’s initial impetus continually 
dissipates because it is overcome by the effect of gravity. The more massive the ascending object, 
the more gravity counteracts its impetus.’ \citep[p.\ 445]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus}

the impetus view of motion. In this study subjects completed several pencil-and-paper problems 
and then explained their answers. Subjects who evidenced the straight-down belief explained 
that when an object is pushed or thrown, it acquires force (i.e., impetus). However, they argued, 
an object that is passively carried by another moving object does not acquire force.’]

require a time-consuming analysis that is not always possible. In order to have a survival
