We've said that infants' competence with causes and objects is not knowledge but something 
more primitive than knowledge, something which exists in adults too and can carry information 
discrepant with what they know. So, if at all, how does appealing to these early capacities 
enable us to explain the origins of knowledge?

Perhaps we can partially resolve the Next Big Problem in the case of colour, and then use 
this as a model for other cases.

        <p class="em-above notes show">In acquiring a colour concept or word you need to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>identify the dimension (colour not shape, size, or ...)</li>
          <li>locate the boundaries</li>

        <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">On locating the boundaries, I think having colour words might be helpful as a way of 
marking a category before you know where its boundaries are.
That is, the word allows you to re-identify a category without knowing where it begins 
or ends.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Given differences between the boundaries of pre-verbal infants' perceptual categories
and the extensions of colour words, it seems unlikely that categorical perception could 
help here.  (Although it is possible in principle that, due to abstract features common to 
all languages' systems of colour words, categorical perception might help; see Kay and ?*.)

        <div class="notes">It's with this first problem that I think categorical perception helps with.
I suggest that categorical perception enables you to lock onto the relevant dimension.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">How?
Categorical perception alters your experience so that there's a correspondence between 
(i) changes on the relevant dimension, and (ii) changes in one phenomenal aspect of your 
experience.
This correspondence helps you, eventually, to lock onto the relevant dimension and so to 
acquire concepts and words.
Let me illustrate.

  <div class="notes">One effect of categorical perception is phenomenological.</div>
  <div class="notes">Consider the (a) difference between an experience of the first blue and the second blue;</div>
  <div class="notes">and (b) the difference between an experience of the second blue and the green.</div>
  <div class="notes">Phenomenally, the second pair of experiences is more different than the first.</div>
  <div class="notes">There is some kind of phenomenological marker of categorical colour properties.</div>
  <div class="notes">To put it colourfully, there is something that it is like for you to experience blue, and something else that it is like for you to experience green.</div>
  <div class="notes">So, to return to the two problems, this is why I think categorical perception might be important for identifying the dimension.</div><img src="/img/slide_cp_02.jpg" class="bkg"/>

  <div class="notes">This picture is about core knowledge, but I think we should broaden that to include categorical perception.</div>
  <div class="notes">In fact I think core knowledge and categorical perception are likely to be closely related, as I'll explain later.</div>
  <div class="notes">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="notes">The question for this lecture was, how do we come to know things about colour.</div>
  <div class="notes">The answer, I think, is this.</div>
  <div class="notes">We have categorical perception of colour from early in infancy, certainly from around four months of age.</div>
  <div class="notes">Having categorical perception is not by itself sufficient for having colour concepts.</div>
  <div class="notes">But it does play an important role, because it means that there is <span>a correspondence between (i) changes on the relevant dimension, and (ii) changes in one phenomenal aspect of our experience.</span></div>
  <div class="notes">I conjecture that this helps us to identify the relevant dimension, colour not shape or size, in acquiring colour words and concepts.</div>
  <div class="notes">But by itself this is not enough.</div>
  <div class="notes">As we've seen, acquiring colour concepts also depends on having some colour words.</div>
  <div class="notes">I speculate that this is because words function as a tool for marking categories prior to knowing where they start and end.</div>
  <div class="notes">The word allows you to re-identify a category without knowing where it begins or ends.</div>
  <div class="notes">So this is my picture.</div>
  <div class="notes">Acquiring knowledge of colour depends on an interaction between categorical perception, something developmentally quite primitive, and social interaction, in particular the negotiation of words for colour categories.</div>
</section>
<section class="slide">
  <div class="notes">To conclude, we've seen that although infants enjoy categorical perception of colour from four months or earlier,</div>
  <div class="notes">this doesn't straightforwardly explain how they come to know about the colours of things.</div>
  <div class="notes">In particular, having categorical perception does not entail having a concept.</div>
  <div class="notes">Nor does having a concept seem to be a matter of somehow redescribing or latching on to what is catgeorically perceived.</div>
  <div class="notes">On the other hand, having colour words and being able to use them accurately does seeem to matter for the acquisition of knowledge of colour.</div>
  <div class="notes">So this is one example where having verbal labels for things may help with acquiring concepts of them.</div>
