          <div class="notes handout">Leslie et al say an object index is ‘a mental token that functions as a pointer to an 
object’ \citep[p.\ 11]{Leslie:1998zk}

it’s a bit like having your fingers on an object: you might not know anything about the 
object, but you can say where it is relative to the other objects you’re fingering.

          <div class="notes">[*TODO*] FINST model has been challenged given later findings!
See \citep[p.\ 59]{scholl:2009_what}:
`I suggest that what Pylyshyn’s (2004) experiments show is exactly what they intuitively 
seem to show: We can keep track of the targets in MOT, but not which one is which. 
This undercuts any reason to suggest that data-driven index maintenance is playing any 
role in MOT, though, since the only way to modify the functioning of indexes to match 
these results would be to strip them of the one property they must have in order to 
fulfill the purpose for which they are theorized to exist in the first place. But again, 
all of this seems easily explained—and perhaps even necessarily predicted—by the view 
that MOT is simply realized by split object-based attention to the MOT targets as a set.'

However, \citep{horowitz:2010_direction} show that, in a MOT paradigm, observers 
can report the direction of one or two targets without advance knowledge of which 
targets' directions they will be asked to report.

It's reasonably obvious that object indexes require segmentation (otherwise how would they
attach to *objects*), and the evidence that they can survive occlusion is relatively easy to
understand.  But the point that having object indexes involves tracking causal interactions
is less straightforward.  So let's consider that ...

        <div class="notes">Object indexes are linked to causation.
In order to track objects, a perceptual system has to be sensitive to be causal interactions
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Why is this true?
Because when you have a causal interaction, there's a conflict between principles of object 
perception e.g. distinct surfaces=>two objects, vs good continuity of motion=>one object
The perceptual system needs to know when conflicts should be reconciled and when they should 
be written off.
We get perceptual effects of causal interactions when there are conflicts among cues of object 
identity.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">This is a point Michotte made.  He found that launching occurs when there is a conflict between 
cues to object identity: good continuity of movement suggests a single object whereas the 
existence of two distinct surfaces indicates two objects.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">It is plausible that other types of causal interaction also involve conflicts between cues 
to object identity.

        </ol>
        <div class="notes">This is an important question insofar as we are concerned with detecting causal interactions.
Is what people detect when the launching effect occurs a causal interaction?
You might say, it can't be a causal interaction 
because no delay between two movements is consistent with a causal interaction.

          </div>
          <p class="em-above notes show">‘anyone not very familiar with the procedure involved in framing the physical concepts of 
inertia, energy, conservation of energy, etc., might think that these concepts are simply 
derived from the data of immediate experience.’

          <div class="notes">How is this consistent with the laws of mechanics—surely no pause can be tolerated? 
Ingeniously, Michotte compares launching with the movement of a single object. The single 
object moves half way across a screen then pauses before continuing to move. Michotte found 
that the longest pause between the two movements consistent with subjects experiencing them 
as a single movement is around 80ms, exactly the longest pause consistent with experiences 
characteristic of launching \citep[pp.\ 91--8, 124]{Michotte:1946nz}. Accordingly, the 
experience characteristic of launching appears to require that the two movements be 
experienced as uninterrupted—--this is why they can be separated by a pause of up to but 
no longer than 80ms.

        <div class="notes">Now I think we have achieved an answer:
        </div>
        <p class="em-above notes show">Perceptual systems identify certain kinds of causal interaction in the course of 
tracking objects.
        </p>
        <div class="notes">The perceptual system responsible for identifying objects must also concern itself with certain 
kinds of causal interaction in order to reconcile conflicting cues to object identity.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">In slightly more detail: one function of our perceptual systems is to identify and track 
objects; this is done by means of various cues; sometimes the visual system is faced with 
conflicting cues to object identity which need to be resolved in order to arrive at a 
satisfactory interpretation; when certain types of causal interaction occur there is a 
conflict among cues to object identity; these conflicts must be treated differently from other 
conflicts because they do not indicate failures of object identification and so do not  
require resolution or further perceptual processing. 
So object perception depends on sensitivity to certain types of causal interaction and this is 
why the launching effect occurs.

sequences, features of the second object (such as motion) remain bound to the first object for 
a short time after the second object starts to move.
