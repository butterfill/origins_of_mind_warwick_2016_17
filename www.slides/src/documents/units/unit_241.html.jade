description: "We saw that there is a theoretical objection to the very notion of core knowledge (/modular representation).  Here we consider some paradigm cases that can be used to ground the notion."

  .notes It's not only that vision and action are not directly influenced by judgement.
  .notes They also seem to be partially separable from each other.

  p.center summary
  ol
    li Illusions provide evidence for information encapsulation and limited accessibility
    li ... so do patterns of deficit;
    li but we need to avoid too simple conclusions
    li because the underlying brain networks are diverse.
    li Appeal to perceptual and motor systems can provide a model.
  .notes So what am I saying?



// structure: (1) modularity --- general solution to the problem
// but modularity leaves open why the looking and not the searching (rather than conversely)?
// because searching is purposive in a way that looking is not?  (searching depends on practical reasoning)
// but why does the module affect looking, which seems purposive?
// Scholl & Leslie --- it's implemented by the finst object indices
//    - use: (p. 12: 'These similarities have led to the view that adult attentional mechanisms may underlie infantsâ€™ performance on object individuation tasks (Carey & Xu, 2001; Chiang & Wynn, 2000; Leslie et al., 1998; Scholl, 2001; Scholl & Leslie, 1999; Simon, 1997; Wynn & Chiang, 1998).')
// So (i) that's why it affects looking; (ii) the principles aren't represented in the simple sense --- they're how the system works
// Further issue: developmental relation between core knowledge of the principles and the kind of knowledge that will inform acting
// - (a) Spelke/Carey joining together with language
// - (b) reflect on categorical perception: maybe it's development as rediscovery
// *also want to work in Michotte -- second take on physical interactions
