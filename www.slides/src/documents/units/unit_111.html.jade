    p What is categorical perception of colour?
    .slide
      .notes Remember the idea that words like 'blue' pick out colour categories?
      .notes To claim that there is categorical perception is, very roughly and to a first approximation, to claim that perceptual processes are concerned not only with the particular colours of things but also with categories of colour like blue and red.
      .notes This is not a definition, only a very rough starting point.

        I can't tell you what categorical perception is.
        The operational definitions used in psychology are unrevealling.
        And the ways philosophers define it are wrong, or at least depend on unjustified
        assumptions.

        But how can we study it without knowing what it is?
        We have to proceed by seeing what conclusions about it are supported by evidence.
        Then we can work back to infer what it is by asking what it could be if these
        conclusions are true.
        Put differently, we can start by asking, What is categorical perception commonly
        taken to explain?

    What is categorical perception of colour commonly taken to explain?
    The diagram below represents sequences of three colours.
    The vertical sequence shows three greens and the uppermost horizontal sequence shows a
    blue, a purple and a pink.

    Each colour differs from its neighbours by the same amount according to a standard
    measure based on the human eye's abilities to discriminate wavelengths.

  .handout.notes
    .notes: :t
      Yet the greens are often judged to look quite similar and the blue-pink-purple to look very different \citep[p.\ 12--7]{Roberson:1999rk}.
      When people are asked to name these colours, they often give the same name to the greens but different names to members of the blue-pink-purple sequence.
      And people are generally faster and more accurate in discriminating between members of the blue-pink-purple sequence than members of the green sequence 
      (faster: \citealp{Bornstein:1984cb}; more accurate: \citealp[p.\ 22--7]{Roberson:1999rk}).

      But these results are not confined to just two sequences.
      There is a way of dividing a colour space into categories that predicts all of these
      results and more.
      When the members of a sequence of colours fall into different categories, the colours
      are said to look very different, they are given different verbal labels, and the
      subject can discriminate them faster and more accurately than when they don't fall
      into different categories (all other things being equal).
      The fact that, for an individual subject, all these effects are predicted by a single
      way of dividing the colour space into categories is what categorical perception of
      colour is supposed to explain.

      So what is categorical perception?
      Categorical perception is the process, whatever it is, that explains the unexpected effects.
      Now this way of defining categorical perception is not very informative.
      This is a virtue---categorical perception is something to be discovered, not defined.
      We might ask, what sort of process is categorical perception?
      In particular, we might wonder whether and in what sense it is a perceptual process.
      How can we discover more about categorical perception?
      One way to do this is to look for further unexpected patterns to be explained.
      It's just here that pop-out is useful.

    
      

+slide_middle
  .notes: :t
    Another measure on which the green sequence differs from the blue-pink-purple sequence is pop-out, which is defined operationally in terms of visual search tasks \citep[p.\ 117]{Treisman:1986pm}.
    First I need to explain what a visual search task is.
    In visual search tasks tasks, subjects are shown an array of objects and asked to identify the one with a certain property.
    For example, one might be shown an array of twenty animal pictures and asked to identify the cat.
    Normally the time it takes subjects to find a target increases linearly as the number of objects in the array increases.
    But when the target of a visual search is defined in terms of colour and the colours of the distractors are categorically different from the colour of the target, subjects can find the target just as quickly when it is in among 36 distractors as when there are only four distractors \citep[Experiment 1]{Daoutis:2006qk}.
    This is, the colours pop out.
  .handout \textbf{pop-out} ‘Such targets pop out of the display, so that the time it takes to find them is independent of the number of distractors’ \citep[p.\ 117]{Treisman:1986pm}.
  .handout When target and distractors differ in colour category there can be pop-out effects \citep{Daoutis:2006qk}.

      Recall that we defined categorical perception in terms of things it could explain.
      Now we can add pop-out to that list.
      This gives us more insight into what categorical perception is.
      In particular, it indicates that categorical perception is a perceptual process.
      And we can go on finding out more about categorical perception by finding out more about the things it explains.
      This is why I refused to define it at the start, and why you have to start without knowing what categorical perception is.

+slide_middle
  p.center methodological aside
  .notes: :t
    Our topic is still categorical perception, but I want to pause here to reflect on how
    we've defined categorical perception.
    We should think of core knowledge using the same method.
    At the outset we don't know what core knowledge is.
    I just said it's like knowledge in some ways but not knowledge.
    We'll get a handle on it by looking at what it is commonly supposed to explain.
    More on this later; now back to categorical perception.

+slide_middle
  .notes Among the things categorical perception is commonly taken to explain there are also automatic processes.
  .notes (This will be important later.)

     A process is \emph{automatic} just if 
     whether it happens is independent of the subject’s task and motivation (to a

section.slide
  .notes For an example of a category effect which is automatic, I need to introduce you to the odd-ball paradigm.
  .notes In the odd-ball paradigm, you see a series of things that are all the same; and then, unpredictably, you see something different.
  .notes We can use sensitivity to odd-balls to measure the difference between the two blues and the blue-green pair.
  .notes This is useful because odd-ball effects can be detected very early in visual processessing, before attention kicks in.
  .notes They allow us to probe automatic processes.

    Now suppose we play you an odd ball sequence.
    We want to know whether an automatic process picks up on the difference.
    And we want to know whether the automatic process picks up on the difference always or only when a category change is involved.
    To do this we need to measure an event-related potential called vMMN (which is short for visual mismatch negativity).

    So let me show you a task that uses this odd-ball effect
    Fixate on this cross.
    And when you see the rectangle, press the space bar with both index fingers.
    That's it.
    Except that you also see a block of colour on every trial.
    You're instructed to ignore this block of colour.
    And generally that's easy because it's always the same colour.
    But just occasionally it's a different colour.
    In one condition, the usual and odd-ball colours are the blues.
    And in the other condition, the usual and odd-ball colours are cross-category, from blue-green.
    We're interested in whether there's a sign that your brain has detected the change when the odd ball colour occurs.
