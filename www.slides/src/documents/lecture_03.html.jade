  p.center question
  .notes: :t
    The question for this course is ...
    We are going to approach this question by examining the evidence from developmental science, 
    and identifying philosophical problems created by the evidence.

+slide
  +discrepantFindingsAboutKnowledgeOfObjects({final:true, handout:false, notes:true})
  .notes: :t
    Suppose we ask,
    When do humans first come to know facts about the locations of objects they
    are not perceiving?
    Some evidence points to an early age, perhaps 2.5 months or earlier.
    But other evidence points to a much later age, 7 months at the earliest.
  .notes: :t
    I’m in the process of arguing this apparently conflicting evidence points to a deep problem about
    how to characterise the mental states and actions of typically developing infants in their first
    months of life, when they can perform some actions for the reason that there is an object behind
    a screen but when this ability is strictly limited.
  .notes: :t
    One simple response would be to 

+slide
  +UncomplicatedAccountOfMindsAndActions
  +show('.generalise, .theAccount', 0)
  .notes: :t
    If I’m right, we need to rethink fundamental claims about mental states.
    These are coded in the Uncomplicated Account of Minds and Actions.
  .notes: :t
    But faced with this, we should try to hold on to the Uncomplicated Account
    for as long as possible.
    There are two ways to do this.
  .slide
    +highlight-row('.claim1')
    .notes: :t
      One possibility is to insist that infants, despite failures to search,
      really can have beliefs about, and knowlegde of, the locations of unseen objects.
      For all we have seen so far, it might be that this is right.
      Perhaps, for example, there is something especially tricky about searching.
      Or perhaps there are other studies which show, contra Shinskey and Munakata,
      that four months olds really can search for unperceived objects.
      This deserves careful investigation.
  .slide
    +unhighlight-row('.claim1')
    +highlight-row('.claim2')
    .notes: :t
      Another possibility is to insist that infants, despite apparently demonstrating
      intelligent responses to unperceived objects in their looking behaviours,
      just can’t act for the reason that there is an object behind a screen.
      Their responses are not really intelligent but driven by some more basic process.
    .notes: :t
      I want to consider this possibility first.

  +discrepantFindingsAboutKnowledgeOfObjects({final:true, handout:false, notes:true})
  .notes: :t
    I suggested that the discrepant findings create a problem for 
    understanding the nature of mental states because they seem to require
    us to reject at least parts of the Uncomplicated Account of Minds and Actions ...

  .notes: :t
    To conclude, the question for this lecture concerned knowledge of physical objects.
    We examined how three requirements on having knowledge of physical objects are met.
    Knowledge of objects depends on abilities to (i) segment objects, (ii) represent them as
    persisting and (iii) track their interactions.
  p Three requirements
  ul
    li segment objects
    li represent objects as persisting (‘permanence’)
    li track objects’ interactions
  .notes: :t
    We looked at each of these in turn and found evidence for two discoveries.
    First infants meet these requirements in the first months of their lives.
+slide
  p Principles of Object Perception
  ul
    li cohesion
      span.step2.grey-text —‘two surface points lie on the same object only if the points are linked by a path of connected surface points’
    li boundedness
      span.step3.grey-text —‘two surface points lie on distinct objects only if no path of connected surface points links them’
      // … the boundedness principle implies that … two distinct objects cannot interpenetrate.’
    li rigidity
      span.step4.grey-text —‘objects are interpreted as moving rigidly if such an interpretation exists’
    li no action at a distance
      span.step5.grey-text —‘separated objects are interpreted as moving independently of one another if such an interpretation exists’
  p.right (Spelke 1990)
  .notes: :t
    Second, a single set of principles is formally adequate to explain how someone could 
    meet these requirements, and to describe infants' abilities with segmentation, 
    representing objects as persisting and tracking objects' interactions.
  .notes: :t
    This left us with the a question about mechanism: What is the relation between these principles
    and infants' competence?
+slide_middle
  p.center.false the simple view
  .notes: :t
    A natuaral answer is the Simple View: #{origins.simple_view}
  +line-through('.false')
  .notes: :t
    However, as we saw, the Simple View must be wrong because it generates incorrect predictions.
    This was the lesson of the discrepancy bewteen looking and search measures for both 
    infants' abilities to represent objects as persisting and their abilities to track causal 
    interactions.
  .notes: :t
    As I've just been arguing, the failure of the Simple View presents us with a problem.
    The problem is to understand the nature of infants' apprehension of the principles given
    that it doesn't involve knowledge.
    This is a problem that will permeate our discussion of the origins of mind because it 
    problems of this form come up again and again in different domains. 
    It isn't the only problem we'll encounter, but none of the problems are more important or more
    general than this one.
