      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

<section class="slide">
  <div class="notes">Not all researchers agree about the properties of modules.  That they are 
informationally encapsulated is denied by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson (2002: 9), 
Simon Baron-Cohen (1995) and some evolutionary psychologists (Buller and Hardcastle 2000: 309), 
whereas Scholl and Leslie claim that information encapsulation is the essence of modularity 
and that any other properties modules have follow from this one (1999b: 133; this also seems 
to fit what David Marr had in mind, e.g. Marr 1982: 100-1).  According to Max Coltheart, 
the key to modularity is not information encapsulation but domain specificity; he suggests 
Fodor should have defined a module simply as 'a cognitive system whose application is domain 
specific' (1999: 118).  Peter Carruthers, on the other hand, denies that domain specificity 
is a feature of all modules (2006: 6).  Fodor stipulated that modules are 
'innately specified' (1983: 37, 119), and some theorists assume that modules, 
if they exist, must be innate in the sense of being implemented by neural regions 
whose structures are genetically specified (e.g. de Haan, Humphreys and Johnson 2002: 207; 
Tanaka and Gauthier 1997: 85); others hold that innateness is 'orthogonal' to modularity 
(Karmiloff-Smith 2006: 568).  There is also debate over how to understand individual 
properties modules might have (e.g. Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994 on the meanings of domain 
specificity; Samuels 2004 on innateness).
  </div>
  <div class="notes">In short, then, theorists invoke many different notions of modularity, each barely different 
from others.  You might think this is just a terminological issue.  I want to argue that 
there is a substantial problem: we currently lack any theoretically viable account of what 
modules are.  The problem is not that 'module' is used to mean different things-after all, 
there might be different kinds of module.  The problem is that none of its various meanings 
have been characterised rigorously enough.  All of the theorists mentioned above except Fodor 
characterise notions of modularity by stipulating one or more properties their kind of module 
is supposed to have.  This way of explicating notions of modularity fails to support principled 
ways of resolving controversy.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">No key explanatory notion can be adequately characterised by listing properties because the 
explanatory power of any notion depends in part on there being something which unifies its 
properties and merely listing properties says nothing about why they cluster together.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">So much the same objections which applied to the very notion of core knowledge 
appear to recur for module.  But note one interesting detail ...

        <div class="notes">Interestingly, Fodor doesn't define modules by specifying a cluster of properties 
(pace Sperber 2001: 51); he mentions the properties only as a way of gesturing towards 
the phenomenon (Fodor 1983: 37) and he also says that modules constitute a natural kind 
(see Fodor 1983: 101 quoted above).

only one paper on this topic, which is by me.
I'm not going to talk about the paper here; let me leave it like this:
if you want to invoke a notion of core knowledge or modularity,
you have to reply to these problems.  And one way to reply to them---
the only way I know---is to develop the idea that modules are a natural 
kind.  If you want to know more ask me for my paper and I'll send it to you.

        <div class="notes">Limited accessibility explains why the representations might drive looking but not reaching.
But doesn't the bare appeal to limited accessibility leave open why the looking and not the searching (rather than conversely)?
I think not, given the assumption that searching is purposive in a way that looking is not.  (Searching depends on practical reasoning.)
We'll come back to this later (if core knowledge of objects involves object files, it's easier to see why it affects looking but not actions like reaching.)

        <div class="notes">Except, of course, calling this an explanation is too much.
After all, limited accessibility is more or less what we're trying to explain.
But this is the first problem --- the problem with the standard way of characterising modularity and core systems merely by listing features.

  <div class="notes">Let me illustrate limited accessibility ...
  </div>
  <div class="notes">Limited accessbility is a familar feature of many cognitive systems.
When you grasp an object with a precision grip, it turns out that there is a very 
reliable pattern.
At a certain point in moving towards it your fingers will reach a maximum grip aperture 
which is normally a certain amount wider than the object to be grasped, and then start to close.
Now there's no physiological reason why grasping should work like this, rather than grip hand 
closing only once you contact the object.
Maximum grip aperture shows anticipation of the object: the mechanism responsible for 
guiding your action does so by representing various things including some features of 
the object.
But we ordinarily have no idea about this.
The discovery of how grasping is controlled depended on high speed photography.
This is an illustration of limited accessibility.
(This can also illustrate information encapsulation and domain specificity.)

although we can suppose that it is characterised by them.

The property that actually explains these is limited accessiblity (domain

          </div>
          <div class="notes">I'm inclined by a view that is both more piecemeal and more unifying:
(a) modules cover a wider range of domains than Carey or Spelke think core systems 
do (not just objects, number, geometry and the rest but also speech, colour
and mental states)
(b) there is less to say about what unifies any of these cases (maybe core knowledge
of objects has more in common with, say, categorical perception of colour than
with core knowledge of action.)
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Certainly the notion of core knowledge or module doesn't save us from needing to look
at particular mechanisms.
I think that thinking about categorical perception, or the perceptual 
systems that underpin objects indexes is a way of getting at what core knowledge really 
involves.  Core systems are not always something over and above perceptual and motor systems
(although it seems probably that they sometimes are if our competence with syntax rests on 
core knowledge).
