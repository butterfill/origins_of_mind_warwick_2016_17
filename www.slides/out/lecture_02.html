We are going to approach this question by examining the evidence from developmental science, 
exploring how it bears on philosophical positions like nativism and empiricsm, 
and identifying philosophical problems created by the evidence.
Our focus is on two breakthrough sets of findings.
One concerns core knowledge, the other social interaction.
One problem for us is that these two sets of findings are typically considered in isolation, 
although I think there are strong reasons to suppose that understanding the origins of knowledge 
will require thinking about both core knowledge and social interaction.

The challenge is to understand how core knowledge and social interaction conspire in the emergence of knowledge.
Well, that's the big picture.
But at this stage in the course I simply want to introduce you to some of the key findings and the puzzles they raise.

          <div class="notes">The question for this lecture concerns knowledge of physical objects.
When do humans first come to know simple facts about particular physical objects?
To illustrate, consider the fact that this telephone is located here,
or the fact that this telephone is square.
I take it that no one is born knowing any such facts.
So there was a time when you knew no facts about particular physical objects at all,
and then, sometime later, you came to know some such facts.
How did you make this transition?
How do humans first come to know facts about particular objects?

          <div class="notes">[features picture]
First, what does knowledge of physical objects involve?
One way to approach this question is by contrasting objects with features.
Physical objects contrast with features in three ways
%
\begin{enumerate}
%
\item physical objects have boundaries whereas mere features do not. (This needs qualifying 
because there is a sense in which we can regard features as having boundaries; but when it 
comes to 
features, the boundaries are merely projections.  To see the contrast, consider that we could 
all be permanently mistaken about the boundaries of a physical object but not about the 
boundaries of a feature---another species could not discover a million years from now that 
humans are wrong about the boundaries of this feature, that they thought it was one feature
whereas really it is two.)
%
\item physical objects persist in a way that features do not.  You cannot ask, concerning a 
feature now, whether this is the same feature as some time ago.  At least, you cannot ask this
in the same sense that you can ask it about a physical objects.
%
\item physical objects can interact with each other in way that features cannot: they
can causally interact.
%
\end{enumerate}
%
Imagine not knowing anything at all about particular physical objects and living in a world
consisting entirely of features.  Nothing interacts, there are only patterns.
And things outside your perceptual field do not exist.
From your point of view, the world is limited your perceptual field now.

  <div class="notes">[features picture]
Recall my imaginary world of features.  In this world there is no principled way of saying 
where one object ends and another begins.
As I said, features differ from genuine objects in not allowing us to make sense of the question of 
whether we are carving them at their joints.
So an ability to segment physical objects is not necessary for knowing anything about
mere features but it is probably necessary for having any knowledge 
concerning particular physical objects.

  <div class="notes">[features picture]
Contrast features again.  You might see this red feature moving across the scene. 
But suppose it disappears and then, later a similar looking feature appears. 
There is no fact of the matter about whether this is the same feature or a different one.
As I mentioned before, in the case of features we can't make sense of them as persisting over 
time, or as there being interruptions in their presence.
I suppose, then, that to have knowledge concerning physical objects rather than merely 
concerning features, it is necessary to be able to represent objects as persisting
even while unperceived.

  <div class="notes">Objects causally interact with each other; one pan supports another, two people collide and 
bounce off each other.  Relatedly, objects have counterfactual lives: sometimes you can say,
truly, that if that barrier had not been there, the car would be at the bottom of the valley 
now.
  </div>
</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/PB042152.JPG" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">[features picture]
As I mentioned, this is another respect in which objects are distinct from features.
Features do not causally interact with each other and they do not have counterfactual lives 
either.
This point of contrast suggests that knowledge concerning physical objects as opposed to mere
features requires at least a limited ability to track causal interactions.

  <div class="notes">So reflection on how physical objects differ from mere features suggests three minimal 
requirements on having any knowledge at all of facts about particular physical objects.
Knowing things about particular physical objects, unlike knowing things about mere features, 
requires abilities to segment objects, to represent them as persisting, and to track at least 
some of their cauasl interactions.

  <div class="notes">[I need to explain the method used in violation-of-expectations, and to compare it with
the method of habituation.]
A violation-of-expectations experiment involves a pair of events.
Infants are divided into two groups; one group sees one event, the other sees the other event.
(This is the between-subject version; it might also be done within subjects.)
The experimenter measures how long the infants look at each event.
Of interest is whether infants reliably look longer at one of the two events.
If they do, this is interpreted as evidence that this event---the one infants reliably look 
longer at---is in some way interesting to them. 
And, if the events are well chosen, their interest indicates that the event violates an
expectation they have.
In the experiment we are considering, the expectation violated is the expectation that 
the two objects should move separately.

        <div class="notes">For example, objects arranged as on your left were percevied by 3-month-olds as two objects, 
whereas infants treated the displays like that on your right as if they were one object.
(This was measured using a habituation paradigm \citep{kestenbaum:1987_perception}.  Infants 
were habituated to the display.  Then either one object's position changed, or both objects' 
positions changed but in such a way as to preserve the overall configuration of the two 
objects.  Infants could show that they perceived the configuration as a single object by 
looking longer when just one object's position changed.)

reaching rather than looking.
Let me explain the stimuli first.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">How does the principle of cohension apply to this moving display? 
As we just formulated it, it doesn't seem to.  After all, in both cases all points on the 
stimuli are lnked by a path of connected surface points.
However, the principle should be read as saying more implying that:
‘When two surfaces are separated by a spatial gap (as in Figure 4a) or undergo relative motions 
that alter the adjacency relations among points at their border (as in Figure 4i), the 
surfaces lie on distinct objects’ \citep[p.\ 49]{Spelke:1990jn}.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The question is, Do infants segment these objects in accordance with the Principle of Cohesion?
\citet[Experiment 2]{spelke:1989_reaching} used a reaching experiment with 5-month-old infants.
The smaller of the two objects was always closer to the infants.  
Infants should reach more often for the smaller, nearer object when they represent the simuli 
as two separate objects than when they represent it as a single object.
(This is not obvious, but the researchers do justify this claim carefully 
\citep[p.\ 186]{spelke:1989_reaching}.)
So the idea is that by comparing how often 5-month-olds reach for the smaller object, we can
see whether they treat it as a separate object in one case but not the other.
To make this vivid, let me show you their apparatus ...

Overall, infants reached to the smaller, top object more often when they moved in opposite

Given the background assumption, this is evidence that infants segmented the objects 
differently depending on their motions, and did so in just the way that adults would

It isn't important that there are exactly four, nor are their precise formulations.
(Surely the principles as stated here are not exactly the principles we need to characterise
how infants segment objects.)
What I want us to focus on is just the fact that we can use a small number of principles to 
characterise how infants segment objects in a way that generates testable predictions,
and these principles have been confirmed.
This motivates us to ask ...
        </div>
        <div class="handout notes">What is the status of these principles?</div>
        <div class="notes">Spelke’s position might be put like this:</div>
        <div class="handout notes">\begin{enumerate}

\item We (as perceivers) start with a cross-modal representation of three-dimensional 
perceptual features which includes their locations and trajectories.

\item Our task is to get from these representations of features to representations of objects.

\item \emph{Descriptive component} We do this as if in accordance with certain principles 
(cohesion, boundedness, rigidity, and no action at a distance).

\item \emph{Explanatory component}  We acquire representations of objects because we apply the 
principles to representations of features and draw appropriate inferences.

\end{enumerate}
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The key point for our purposes is the explanatory component.
The principles are not supposed to be merely heuristics for describing and predicting infants’ 
performance on preferential looking tasks.
Rather, these principles are supposed to explain why infants look longer at some things than at 
others.
This what motivates the hypothesis that infants know these principles and use them in 
reasoning about objects: unless this hypothesis is true, it’s hard to understand how the 
principles could have explanatory relevance.

Marr showed that many visual processes can be modelled as inferences.
And Chomsky pioneered the idea that our knowledge of language depends on knowledge of

What unites these three cases, Spelke on object segmentation, Marr on vision and Chomsky on 
syntax?
It’s that they are straightforwardly cognitivist in appeal to knowledge and inference.
Principles are known, and they are used via a process of inference.

the vocabulary in which Chomsky frames linguistic issues is explicitly epistemological.  
Thus, the grammar of a language specifies what its speaker/hearers have to know qua speakers 
and hearers; and the goal of the child’s language acquisition process is to construct a 
theory of the language that correctly expresses this grammatical knowledge.’

In that case, asking hard questions about their status would hardly be necessary.
So let’s consider further evidence for these principles.
We can do this by turning from segmentation (which was our first requirement on knowledge of 
objects) 
to representing objects as permanent.

          <div class="notes">We're considering abilities to represent objects as persisting even when not perceived. 
Where are we?
We've seen that characteristing these abilities in terms of Principles of Object Perception
enables us to make testable predictions, many of which have been confirmed.
Importantly, we made the same claim about these Principles for abilities to segment objects.
The abilities to segment objects and to represent them as persisting are conceptually 
distinct.
However it may be that beliefs about a single set of principles underlies both abilities.
This is one of Spelke's brilliant insights.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Where does this leave us?
We still want to know about the status of the principles of object perception.
As I said before, it is one thing to say they are descriptively adequate and another thing
to understand how the Princples relate to cognitive mechanisms (processes and 
representations).
But now the question about the status of these Principles is more pressing because 
the claim that these principles of object perception explain infants' (and adults', 
and other primates') performance is now harder to reject.
It's harder to reject because we have converging evidence for the psychological reality of 
the principles from both segmentation and permanence.

This raises two questions: How do we arrive at these expectations? and What is an 
expectation?
Spelke's claim is that we arrive at these expectations by inference from the Principles of 
Object Perception, including the principle of contintuity.
So what is an expectation?  
On the simple view we are adopting for now, an expectation is just a belief.
The attraction of this simple view is it allows us to take literally the claim that we know 
the principles of object perception and arrive at expectations by a process of inference.

In particular, I want to discuss an essay outline and a draft of your essay.

for instance, revising an outline or essay), (b) you receive feedback from peers as well as 
tutors or lecturers, and you can combine feedback from others (peers, and lecturers or 
tutors) with self-assessment.
Overall, my aim is to make feedback part of a continuing dialog rather than something you get
only after you've done all the thinking on an issue that you're going to do.

Now I was assuming it would be ok because the students last year seemed to like it a lot.
But then it struck me that maybe you are different.  So please let me know.

It is perhaps hard to accept that four-month-old infants are in the business of formulating and revising hypotheses.
(Come to think of it, it’s quite hard to accept that adults typically acquire representations of unperceived objects by formulating and revising hypotheses.)
Also we might think of inference as something that a detective does.  It is not obvious that the same process is occurring in infants.
But these considerations are narrowly intuitive.
Science sometimes indicates that intuitions are wrong, even intuitions about very fundamental things like space and time.
And, most importantly, if infants aren’t making inferences on the basis of knowlegde, what are they doing that enables them to pass violation-of-expectation tasks?

          <div class="notes">What about the chicks and dogs?
This isn't straightforward.
As I mentioned earlier, \citep{kundey:2010_domesticated} show that domestic dogs are good 
at solidity on a search measure.  And as we covered in seminars, 
\citep{chiandetti:2011_chicks_op} demonstrate object permanence with a search measure in 
chicks that are just a few days old.
Indeed, for many of the other animals I mentioned, object permanence is measured in search 
tasks, not with looking times.
To speculate, it may be that the looking/search dissociation is more likely to occur in
adult animals the more closely related they are to humans.
But let's focus on the fact that you get the looking/search in any adult animals at all.
This is evidence that the dissociation is a consequence of something fundamental about 
cognition rather than just a side-effect of some capacity limit.

          <div class="notes">The problem is quite general.
It doesn't arise only in the case of knowledge of objects but also in other domains 
(like knowledge of number and knowledge of mind).
And it doesn't arise only from evidence about infants or nonhuman primates; it would also 
arise if our focus were exclusively on human adults.
More on this later.
For now, our aim is to better understand the problem as it arises in the case of knowledge of objects.

          <div class="notes">We need to say what we mean by representation.
The term is used in a wide variety of ways.
As I use it, representation is just a generic term covering knowledge, belief and much else besides.

This is a step in the right direction.
But it tells us that we represent them without knowing them.

        <div class="notes">To conclude, the question for this lecture concerned knowledge of physical objects.</div>
        <div class="notes">We examined how three requirements on having knowledge of physical objects are met.</div>
        <div class="notes">Knowledge of objects depends on abilities to (i) segment objects, (ii) represent them as persisting and (iii) track their interactions.</div>
        <p>Three requirements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>segment objects</li>
          <li>represent objects as persisting (‘permanence’)</li>
          <li>track objects’ interactions</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="notes">We looked at each of these in turn and found evidence for two discoveries.
First infants meet these requirements in the first months of their lives.

        <div class="notes">Second, a single set of principles is formally adequate to explain how someone could 
meet these requirements, and to describe infants' abilities with segmentation, 
representing objects as persisting and tracking objects' interactions.

          <p class="center false">the simple view</p>
          <div class="notes">A natuaral answer is the Simple View: the principles of object perception are things that we know or believe, and we generate expectations from these principles by a process of inference.

          <div class="notes">However, as we saw, the Simple View must be wrong because it generates incorrect predictions.
This was the lesson of the discrepancy bewteen looking and search measures for both 
infants' abilities to represent objects as persisting and their abilities to track causal 
interactions.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">As I've just been arguing, the failure of the Simple View presents us with a problem.
The problem is to understand the nature of infants' apprehension of the principles given
that it doesn't involve knowledge.
This is a problem that will permeate our discussion of the origins of mind because it 
problems of this form come up again and again in different domains. 
It isn't the only problem we'll encounter, but none of the problems are more important or more
general than this one.
