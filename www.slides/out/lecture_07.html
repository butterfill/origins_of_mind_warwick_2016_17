          <div class="notes">Recall that our Next Big Problem is this. 
We've said that infants' competence with causes, objects and colours is not knowledge but 
something more primitive than knowledge, 
something involving perceptual processes, such as categorical perception.
These processes exist in adults too and can carry information 
discrepant with what they know.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">The Next Big Problem is, How does appealing to these early-developing capacities 
enable us to explain the origins of knowledge?

            <div class="notes">This is the point where we turn to social interaction.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">My proposal is that the answer to Our Next Big Problem hinges on social interaction.
Early developing capacities to deal with objects, causes, colours and the rest enable the
emergence of knowledge only in combination with rich forms of social interaction.
            </div>
            <div class="notes">But what are these forms of social interaction and how do they work?
This is the question that will occupy us in the next lectures.

        <div class="notes">In the lecture on categorical perception I sketched a very rough answer.
The idea is that categorical perception--and the perceptual processes associated with infants'
capacities to deal with objects and causes--are important because they provide phenomenal 
markers.  
They do not reveal that there something has a certain categorical colour property, or that
an event is a certain type of causal interaction.
But they do allow infants to discriminate between these things.
They are, if you like, highlighted in their experience, but not in a way that reveals their 
nature.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">A key part of this picture is that these capacities only support the emergence of knowledge 
about objects or colours or causes in connection with social interaction and language.
It is now time to consider the language part of this ...

You might think, before we ask about communication with words we should ask about communicative 
actions, and before we ask about communicative actions we should ask about actions.
I wondered about aproaching it that way too, starting with action and working up.
But in the end I thought that right now you most of you are probably most interested in language, so most of you would probably find it most interesting to go backwards.

          <div class="notes">There is reason to doubt that we can seriously discuss the nature of humans' abilities to 
communicate at all.
Chomsky holds that ‘the topic of successful communication in the actual world is far too 
complex and obscure’ to say anything systematic about (Chomsky 1992: 120). It’s a mistake, he 
thinks, to try to understand language by focussing on communication (compare Chomsky 2000: 30).

          <div class="notes">I think Chomsky’s challenge is a serious one.  We don't need to debate whether Chomsky is right.
We merely need to note that, right now, 
not very much is actually known about the nature of communication with words.

  <div class="words">
    <div class="container_12">
      <div class="grid_12"> 
        <div class="notes">Consider an utterance of sentence like 'Isabel slept and Lily cried'.
What is the structure of this utterance?
First we can break the sentence down into two sentences and a connective.
Then we break these into words.
And the words break down into phonemes.
Which are eventually realised in continous bodily movements and the sounds these produce.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">This is a very simplified picture.
But already we can see that comprehending an utterance will involve several steps.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Consider someone experiencing linguistic communication for the first time.
She is experiences continuous bodily movements and their acoustic consequences.
From these she has somehow to extract the phonetic gestures.
And then she has to group the phonetic gestures into words.
And finally she has to work out the syntactic structure of the words.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">It turns out that the abilities to make these different steps involves largely different 
mechanisms, and that the steps can be made independently of each other (not that there aren’t 
bottom-up and top-down effects, just that these appear to be inessential in some cases).
Our question can be broken down accordingly.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Our question, How do humans first come to communicate with words?
We can break the process of language comprehension into a series of transitions, from bodily 
movements and their acoustic effects to phonemes, etc.
And we can think of language production as involving the same transitions, but in reverse.
And then our question can be broken down accordingly.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">We don't have to ask how humans come to have abilities to communicate by language all in one go.
Instead we can ask how humans come to be able to identify phonemes in continous bodily movements and their acoustic effects, and how they come to identify words from uninterrupted sequences of phonemes, and so on.
In this way, our question becomes tractable.

          <p class="center notes show ctd">How do humans first come to communicate with words?</p>
          <div class="notes">Is much to large a question to consider.
What I am going to--and what many researchers have done--is to focus on 1-word utterances.
This means (a) ignoring syntactic structure; and (b) taking for granted that infants can 
identify various utterances of a particular word as actions of a single type.
In effect, then, we are focussing on meaning in its simplest form.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">This is not to say that questions about syntax, phoneme recognition and the rest are 
unimportant.  On the contrary, if I had more time I would devote a lecture to each of these.

On one picture the infant is an outsider who might as well be observing those around her through a telescope.
On the other picture the child is a blank to be shaped by those around her.
There is no meaningful interaction between the infant and adults around her; or, if there is, it makes no difference to her development.
But could there be a role for social interaction in learning the meanings of words?

These children invent their own sign languages, which are called homesigns.  Their invented languages are not as rich as those of children who experience other people's languages, but they have many of the same features (Goldin-Meadow 2002, 2003).  These deaf children have somehow worked out for themselves what linguistic communication is and they have found a way of doing it.  They have invented languages with no prior experience of language, and they have invented languages in a modality that people around them barely use in linguistic communication.  These linguistically isolated deaf children have answered in practice the questions that these lectures are about.</div>

She holds her index finger on her nose and extends it outward (= long-straight-nose). She wiggles her palm back and forth (= swim).” (Goldin-Meadow 2003: 171, figure 22)</div>

It would be easy for the children to make up a new gesture to fit every new situation (and, indeed, that appears to be what hearing speakers do when they gesture along with their speech, cf. McNeill, 1992). But that’s not what the deaf children do.  They develop a stable store of forms which they use in a range of situations-they develop a lexicon, an essential component of all languages (Goldin-Meadow, Butcher, Mylander, & Dodge, 1994).’ \citep[p.\ 1389]{Goldin-Meadow:2002dq}</div>

  .notes We can deepen this criticism of the mapping idea with an exercursion into philosophy of language.
  .notes Recall this quesiton, which we asked earlier.
  p.notes.show What do I know or understand when I can communicate with language?
  .notes I take it that proponents of mapping think the answer is a word-concept mapping, where the concept is the meaning of the word.
  .notes But here we should step back and ask how this knowledge is supposed to explain
  .notes The key is to start with a mildly sceptical attitude towards notions like meaning and concept.
  .notes They should only be introduced if we can say clearly why they are necessary.
  .notes On one way of thinking about what word meanings are for, they are necessary only to explain systematicity and productivity.

  p.center objection
  .notes I've focussed on “puttaputta” because it illustrates how even children with normal experiences of language sometimes coin their own words as soon as they start using words.
  .notes You might object that “puttaputta” is a very primitive use of language, somewhere between a word and a sentence.
  .notes But children also coin proper words such as “fire-dog” for a stray dog found near a fire (Clark 1998: 14) and “darking” for the action of colouring.
  .notes Here's an example:
+slide
  .notes This exeample shows Shem inventing the word “smashit.”  This is a nice complex example involving a noun probably derived from a verb (to smash) where Shem simultaneously explains what the word means and refines its pronunciation:
  .notes Shem is age 2;3.21

          <div class="notes">If the shipwreck survivor view were right, communication with words would not help us to explain
the emergence of abilities to know things about objects, causes, colours and the rest.
After all, it presupposes some knowledge of these things.
And, anyway, the shipwreck survivor view seems not to get at the hardest parts of how 
children come to communicate with words because it cannot handle their creativity.
It is based on a mistaken view about the nature of words as being conventionally linked to 
concepts.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">The lab rat view would help, since it presupposes no knowledge in the acquisition of abilities 
to communicate with words.
But the lab rat view is as clearly wrong as any view in philosophy.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">So our Next Big Problem was to understand how early developing capacities lead to knowledge.
My proposal was that we tackle this by thinking about social interaction, and language 
acquisition in particular.
But this has merely led us to Yet Another Problem.

          <div class="notes">The problem is that we don't know how children might first come to communicate with words.

          <div class="notes">To make progress with this problem it may be useful to switch from thinking about communication
with words to thinking about non-verbal communication ...

          <div class="notes">Why is this significant?</div>
          <div class="notes">Because it implies two things:</div>
          <div class="notes">First, it implies that infants' pointing is referential communication; that is, communication about an object.</div>
          <div class="notes">(Contrast sharing a smile; we're communicating, but not necessarily referring.)</div>
          <div class="notes">Second, it implies that infants have some understanding of joint engagement.</div>
