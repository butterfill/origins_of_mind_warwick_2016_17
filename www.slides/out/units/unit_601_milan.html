          <div class="notes">I talked about the notion of core knowledge in the very first lecture, but since then I

This is deliberate because the notion is tricky; so I thought it would be good to postpone
our discussion of it for as long as possible.
Now I can put it off no longer.

          <div class="notes">The first, very minor thing is to realise that there are two closely related notions, core 
knowledge and core system.
These are related this: roughly, core knowledge states are the states of core systems.  More 
carefully:
          </div>
          <div class="handout notes">
            For someone to have \textit{core knowledge of a particular principle or fact} is for her to have a core system where 
            either the core system includes a representation of that principle or else the principle plays a special role in describing the core system.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">So we can define core knowlegde in terms of core system.</div>

        <div class="handout">\subsection{Two-part definition}</div>
        <div class="notes">There are two parts to a good definition.  The first is an analogy that helps us get a fix on what we is meant by 'system' generally.  (The second part tells us which systems are core systems by listing their characteristic features.)</div>

        <div class="notes">So talk of core knowledge is somehow supposed to latch onto the idea of a system.</div>
        <div class="notes">What do these authors mean by talking about 'specialized perceptual systems'?</div>
        <div class="notes">They talk about things like perceiving colour, depth or melodies.</div>
        <div class="notes">Now, as we saw when talking about categorical perception of colour, we can think of the 'system' underlying categorical perception as largely separate from other cognitive systems--- we saw that they could be knocked out by verbal interference, for example.</div>
        <div class="notes">So the idea is that core knowledge somehow involves a system that is separable from other cognitive mechanisms.</div>
        <div class="notes">As Carey rather grandly puts it, understanding core knowledge will involve understanding something about 'the architecture of the mind'.</div>

I think the answer is, basically, yes.  Categorical perception involves a system that has
many of the features associated with core knowledge.

We have introduced it by providing a list of features.
But why suppose that this particular list of features constitutes a natural kind?
This worry has been brought into sharp focus by criticisms of 'two systems' approaches.

        <div class="notes">Look at those features characterising core knowledge as defined by Carey and Spelke again
-- innate, encapsulated, unchanging and the rest.
None of these straightforwardly enable us to predict that core knowledge of objects will 
guide looking but not reaching.
(I'll say in a moment: 
The iconic format is important, but because it explains a missing feature, namely limited
accessibility.)

  <div class="notes">Limited accessbility is a familar feature of many cognitive systems.</div>
  <div class="notes">When you grasp an object with a precision grip, it turns out that there is a very reliable pattern.</div>
  <div class="notes">At a certain point in moving towards it your fingers will reach a maximum grip aperture which is normally a certain amount wider than the object to be grasped, and then start to close.</div>
  <div class="notes">Now there's no physiological reason why grasping should work like this, rather than grip hand closing only once you contact the object.</div>
  <div class="notes">Maximum grip aperture shows anticipation of the object: the mechanism responsible for guiding your action does so by representing various things including some features of the object.</div>
  <div class="notes">But we ordinarily have no idea about this.</div>

        <div class="notes show">
          <p>core systems -- questions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Is appealing to core systems (modules) explanatory?</li>
            <li>Can the Core Knowledge View explain the discrepancy?</li>
            <li>Is the view I've been developing consisten with the Core Knowledge View?</li>
            <li>Is core knowledge all one thing?</li>
            <li>How do you get from core knowledge to knowledge knowledge?</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The Core Knowledge View is the view that infants' competence with objects, causes, colours
and the rest depends not on knowledge (as the Simple View has it) but on core knowledge.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the first question, I could tell you a long story about computational processes and 
representational formats.  But I won't do that here.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the second question, I think the answer is probably yes because the difference in
representational formats between knowledge proper and core knowledge explains limited
accessibility, and this in turn partially explains the discrepancies.
(But note that it doesn't explain is why the discrepacies fall exactly where they do.)
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the third question, I think that thinking about categorical perception, or the perceptual 
systems that underpin objects indexes is a way of getting at what core knowledge really 
involves.  Core systems are not always something over and above perceptual and motor systems
(although it seems probably that they sometimes are if our competence with syntax rests on 
core knowledge).
        </div>
        <div class="notes">On the fourth question,
Most people are committed to there being different stories for (a) colour (categorical 
perception); (b) syntax (tacit knowledge); and (c) physical objects.
I'm not sure. I'm tempted to think that perceptual and motor cognition are at the root of these 
in every case, but this is a radical idea for which there is currenly very little evidence.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The fifth question is just a variant of what I called The Problem (see lecture 2; it arises 
from the failure of the Simple View).
