How do humans come to know about objects, causes, words, numbers, colours, actions or minds? 

At the start of life humans know nothing, or not very much. 
Sometime later we do know some things.
How does the transition occur?

The question has baffled philosophers since Plato or earlier. Recent scientific breakthroughs have transformed our understanding of the question.  Infants enjoy surprisingly rich social abilities. And the use of new, more sensitive---and sometimes controversial---methods has revealed that preverbal infants have surprisingly sophisticated expectations about objects, causal interactions, numerosity, actions, mental states and more besides. But these breakthroughs raise as many puzzles as they solve.  

We will examine these puzzles using a range of conceptual tools from philosophy. Our aim is to understand the developmental origins of mind.

Let me stress that the website is for an old version of the course.  I’ve given versions of this course in four universities (Warwick, CEU, Milan, Tuebingen) and I’m still making quite substantial changes.

I’m going to try out a new mode of assessment with this module.  Most modules require you to submit an essay worth 15% in the term the module runs.  For this module, you will be asked to submit 500 word mini essays for seven seminars, and to peer review others’ mini essays.  Your four best mini essays and your four best peer reviews will determine the mark for 15% of the module. If you want to know more about assessment, I’ve created a document to outline how it works.
