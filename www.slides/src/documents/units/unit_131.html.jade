  p.center Our Next Big Problem
  .notes: :t
    Recall that our Next Big Problem is this. 
    We've said that infants' competence with causes and objects is not knowledge but something 
    more primitive than knowledge, something which exists in adults too and can carry information 
    discrepant with what they know. So, if at all, how does appealing to these early capacities 
    enable us to explain the origins of knowledge?
  .notes: :t
    As we've just seen, a version of this problem arises for the case of colour.
    Perhaps we can partially resolve the Next Big Problem in the case of colour, and then use 
    this as a model for other cases.

    Here's a first attempt to understand the ‘building blocks’ metaphor.
    Let's suppose that categorical perception of colour amounts to having colour concepts.
    This way of thinking concords with Leslie's view about modular cognition.

    It can't be right that having categorical perception of colour (or X) amounts to having colour (or X) concepts.
    We know this can't be right because there is a gap of two or more years between categorical perception of colour and possession of colour concepts.
    For consider what is involved in having a colour concept.
    It is not just responding differently to red things than to green things (say).

    So the first view can't be right.
    It can't be right that having categorical perception of colour (or X) amounts to having colour (or X) concepts.
    And the same applies in other cases of categorical perception as well.
    (Of course a defender of the view that categorical perception is or entails concept possession might insist that subjects have concepts but cannot use them,
    at least not in the sort of task I have just described. This is possible, of course, but it seems to be a desperate defence.)
    How else might we understand the ‘building blocks’ metaphor?

    So the second view probably isn't right either.
    For whatever redescription amounts to, it should surely involve there being some kind of match between the perceptual categories and the concepts.
    And, on the face of, it there is no match at all.

    So what are we to make of the ‘building blocks’ idea?
    It may be that we have to reject the building blocks idea altogether.
    For infant categorical perception of colour seems only very distantly related to adult uses of colour concepts.
    Does this mean that categorical perception plays no role at all in explaining the emergence of knowledge about colours?
    No, we haven't shown that.  Only that categorical perception alone is not enough; and also that  
    it is hard to understand exactly how categorical perception plays a role in the emergence of knowledge.

  p.center development as rediscovery

+slide
  .notes How might the idea of development as rediscovery apply in the case of knowledge of colour?
  p.em-above.notes.show In acquiring a colour concept or word you need to:
  ol.hem-around-children
    li identify the dimension (colour not shape, size, or ...)
    li locate the boundaries
  .slide
    +highlight-row('li:eq(1)')
    .notes: :t
      On locating the boundaries, I think having colour words might be helpful as a way of 
      marking a category before you know where its boundaries are.
      That is, the word allows you to re-identify a category without knowing where it begins 
      or ends.
    .notes: :t
      Given differences between the boundaries of pre-verbal infants' perceptual categories
      and the extensions of colour words, it seems unlikely that categorical perception could 
      help here.  (Although it is possible in principle that, due to abstract features common to 
      all languages' systems of colour words, categorical perception might help; see Kay and ?*.)
  .slide
    +unhighlight-row('li:eq(1)')
    +highlight-row('li:eq(0)')
    .notes: :t
      It's with this first problem that I think categorical perception helps with.
      I suggest that categorical perception enables you to lock onto the relevant dimension.
    .notes: :t
      How?
      Categorical perception alters your experience so that there's a correspondence between 
      (i) changes on the relevant dimension, and (ii) changes in one phenomenal aspect of your 
      experience.
      This correspondence helps you, eventually, to lock onto the relevant dimension and so to 
      acquire concepts and words.
      Let me illustrate.

+slide({bkg:'slide_cp_02.jpg'})
  .notes: :t
    One effect of categorical perception is phenomenological.
    Consider the (a) difference between an experience of the first blue and the second blue;
    and (b) the difference between an experience of the second blue and the green.
    Phenomenally, the second pair of experiences is more different than the first.
    There is some kind of phenomenological marker of categorical colour properties.
    To put it colourfully, there is something that it is like for you to experience blue, and something else that it is like for you to experience green.
    So, to return to the two problems, this is why I think categorical perception might be important for identifying the dimension.


+slide
  .notes Let me return to the picture I finished with at the end of the last lecture.
  p.center
    +img_clip('fig_rediscovery.png')
  .notes: :t
    This picture is about core knowledge, but I think we should broaden that to include categorical perception.
    In fact I think core knowledge and categorical perception are likely to be closely related, as I'll explain later.
  .notes: :t
    The question for this lecture was, how do we come to know things about colour.
    The answer, I think, is this.
    We have categorical perception of colour from early in infancy, certainly from around four months of age.
    Having categorical perception is not by itself sufficient for having colour concepts.
    But it does play an important role, because it means that there is 
    a correspondence between (i) changes on the relevant dimension, and (ii) changes in one phenomenal aspect of our experience.
    I conjecture that this helps us to identify the relevant dimension, colour not shape or size, in acquiring colour words and concepts.
    But by itself this is not enough.
    As we've seen, acquiring colour concepts also depends on having some colour words.
    I speculate that this is because words function as a tool for marking categories prior to knowing where they start and end.
    The word allows you to re-identify a category without knowing where it begins or ends.
  .notes: :t
    So this is my picture.
    Acquiring knowledge of colour depends on an interaction between categorical perception, something developmentally quite primitive, and social interaction, in
    particular the negotiation of words for colour categories.
 


  
+slide_middle
  .notes: :t
    To conclude, we've seen that although infants enjoy categorical perception of colour from four months or earlier,
    this doesn't straightforwardly explain how they come to know about the colours of things.
    In particular, having categorical perception does not entail having a concept.
    Nor does having a concept seem to be a matter of somehow redescribing or latching on to what is catgeorically perceived.
    On the other hand, having colour words and being able to use them accurately does seeem to matter for the acquisition of knowledge of colour.
    So this is one example where having verbal labels for things may help with acquiring concepts of them.
