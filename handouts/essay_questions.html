<h1 id="wildcard-task-ask-a-question">Wildcard Task: Ask a Question</h1>
<p>Ask a question in or after a lecture, in person or by email. Write up the question you asked, the answer you got, and your reflections on the question and answer.</p>
<p>You should complete this task, either in addition to the tasks below or in place of one of them (you can choose which task to substitute).</p>
<h1 id="task-1-introduce-a-scientific-paper">Task 1: Introduce a scientific paper</h1>
<p>Take one of these papers:</p>
<ul>
<li>R. Baillargeon. 1987. “Object permanence in 3.5-and 4.5-month-old infants”.
Developmental psychology 23 (5): 655–664</li>
<li>Jeanne Shinskey and Yuko Munakata. 2001. “Detecting transparent barriers: clear evidence against the means-end deficit account of search failures”. Infancy 2 (3): 395–404</li>
<li>Cinzia Chiandetti and Giorgio Vallortigara. 2011. “Intuitive physical reas- oning about occluded objects by inexperienced chicks” [in en]. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 278, no. 1718 (September): 2621–2627. doi:10.1098/rspb.2010.2381</li>
</ul>
<p>Your task is to write the text for a presentation to introduce the paper. This text should answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>What question is the paper intended to answer?</p></li>
<li><p>Who are the subjects of the experiment(s)?</p></li>
<li><p>What materials did the experiment(s) involve?</p></li>
<li><p>What was the procedure?</p></li>
<li><p>What were the main results?</p></li>
<li><p>What did the researchers conclude from these results?</p></li>
<li><p>What further questions arise from all of this?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the paper has multiple experiments, don’t describe them all. Pick the most interesting.</p>
<p>You should probably not describe all the control conditions. But you should be prepared to explain them in response to questions.</p>
<h1 id="task-2-write-a-review-of-some-scientific-research">Task 2: Write a review of some scientific research</h1>
<h2 id="suggested-question">Suggested question</h2>
<p>Can 4-month-old infants represent objects they are not perceiving?</p>
<h4 id="aim">Aim</h2>
<p>The aim of this first essay is just to get you reading scientific papers and to practice writing about evidence. Later essays will demand more analysis. But for this essay it’s enough to provide a review of some scientific research.</p>
<h4 id="hint">Hint</h2>
<p>In this essay you might:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>review some of evidence that infants can represent objects they are not perceiving (see readings, especially <span class="citation">(Baillargeon 1987)</span>);</p></li>
<li><p>consider the apparently conflicting findings that infants cannot do this <span class="citation">(Shinskey and Munakata 2001)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>attempt to resolve the conflict.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="hints">Hints</h2>
<p>Your review should start by stating the essay’s aim and briefly outlining what it achieves.</p>
<p>You should discuss one or more of the main claims defended in the essay. It may be useful to mention sources the author has not considered, or to raise objections.</p>
<p>Discussion of the essay’s flaws is important. But make sure that adverse criticism is carefully justified.</p>
<p>If you can, suggest how the essay could be improved.</p>
<h1 id="alternative-essay-question-for-task-2">Alternative Essay Question for Task 2</h1>

<p>What do 6-month-olds know about physical objects’ causal interactions?</p>
<h2 id="aim-1">Aim</h2>
<p>The aim of this first essay is just to get you reading scientific papers and to practice writing about evidence. Later essays will demand more analysis. But for this essay it’s enough to provide a review of some scientific research.</p>
<h2 id="peer-review-1">Peer review</h2>
<p>Your review essay will be subject to peer review (see Task 3). Another student in your seminar group will be assigned as your reviewer. You should send the essay to your reviewer by 6pm on the Monday before your seminar.</p>
<h2 id="hint-1">Hint</h2>
<p>In this essay you might:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>review some of the evidence that infants can track causal interactions (see readings, <span class="citation">(Spelke et al. 1992)</span> or <span class="citation">(Leslie and Keeble 1987)</span>);</p></li>
<li><p>consider findings that are hard to reconcile with the claim that infants’ simply know that barriers stop objects (see <span class="citation">(Hood, Carey, and Prasada 2000; Hood, Cole-Davies, and Dias 2003)</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>attempt to resolve the conflict (potentially useful sources include <span class="citation">(Haith 1998; Keen 2003)</span>)</p></li>

<h1 id="task-4-plan-an-essay">Task 4: Plan an essay</h1>
<p>In this task you identify a question for your unassessed essay, do some background reading and produce an outline for the essay plus a list of readings.</p>
<p>You can take one of the suggested questions from the list provided. Or, if you prefer, you can propose your own question (which will need to be approved before you can submit the essay).</p>
<p>Send your essay plan to your seminar leader by 6pm on the Monday before your seminar.</p>
<h1 id="pre-approved-essay-questions">Pre-approved essay questions</h1>
<p><em>For any of these questions, your answer may focus on a particular domain, such as core knowledge of objects or of number. You are not required to provide a comprehensive survey.</em></p>
<p><em>The readings suggested here are for general guidance. You’re welcome to see me to discuss readings in relation to your plans for the essay.</em></p>
<h2 id="mindreading">Mindreading</h2>
<p>What is the puzzle about when humans can first represent others’ beliefs? How might the puzzle be resolved?</p>
<h3 id="reading-1">—Reading</h3>
<h2 id="core-knowledge">Core knowledge</h2>
<p>What is core knowledge and what role, if any, could it play in explaining the transition from being unable to know things to being able to know things?</p>
<h3 id="reading-2">—Reading</h3>
<h2 id="innateness">Innateness</h2>
<p>What if anything is innate in humans?</p>
<p>Hint: You should be careful to examine the notion of innateness (see <span class="citation">(Samuels 2004)</span>). Otherwise the reading is divided into topics; you should not try to cover all topics. I also suggest <em>not</em> structuring your essay by topic.</p>
<h3 id="reading-3">—Reading</h3>
<h3 id="reading-comparative-cross-species">—Reading: comparative (cross-species)</h3>
<h3 id="reading-syntax">—Reading: syntax</h3>
<p>Note: this is one-sided.</p>
<h3 id="reading-replying-to-fodors-argument">—Reading: replying to Fodor’s argument</h3>
<p>chapters 4, 8</p>
<p>(There is also an exchange between Carey and Rey forthcoming in the journal Mind and Language—their papers may be available by the time you read this.)</p>
<h2 id="knowledge-of-colour">Knowledge of colour</h2>
<p>At birth humans do not know this lime fruit is green whereas that tomato is red. How could some humans come to be in a position to know this?</p>
<p>Hint: you should discuss categorical perception of colour and its relation to knowledge. There was a lecture on this topic; the handout includes many references.</p>
<h3 id="reading-4">—Reading</h3>
<h2 id="social-interaction">Social interaction</h2>
<p>If humans were incapable of social interaction and could only observe each other from behind one-way mirrors (if such a thing existed), how if at all would this affect the processes by which they get to know things?</p>
<h3 id="reading-5">—Reading</h3>
<p>[Read the commentaries.]</p>
<h2 id="joint-action">Joint action</h2>
<p>Could there be a role for joint action in explaining how humans come to know things about other minds?</p>
<h3 id="reading-6">—Reading</h3>
<h2 id="language">Language</h2>
<p>‘Children learn words through the exercise of reason’ (BLOOM). Discuss.</p>
<p>Note: the reading for this is one-sided, which makes this question difficult.</p>
<h3 id="reading-7">—Reading</h3>
<h2 id="section"></h2>
<h1 id="task-6-write-an-essay">Task 6: Write an essay</h1>
<h2 id="suggested-question-2">Suggested question</h2>
<p>What is ‘shared intentionality’ and what might it explain?</p>
<p>Compare <span class="citation">Tomasello et al. (2005, 688)</span>: ‘Our ... hypothesis is that it is precisely these two developing capacities [to read intentions and to share psychological states] that interact during the first year of life to create the normal human developmental pathway leading to participation in collaborative cultural practices.’</p>
<h3 id="reading-theoretical">—Reading: theoretical</h3>
<p>Pick one of these (first is probably the best; last is shortest; the middle one comes with critical commentaries).</p>
