This is deliberate because the notion is tricky; so I thought it would be good to postpone
our discussion of it for as long as possible.

        <div class="notes">Now, as we saw when talking about categorical perception of colour, we can think of the 'system' underlying categorical perception as largely separate from other cognitive systems--- we saw that they could be knocked out by verbal interference, for example.</div>

I've put a recent quote from Spelke and Lee on your handout to illustrate 
a different idea.

          <div class="handout">‘We hypothesize that uniquely human cognitive achievements build on systems that humans 
share with other animals: core systems that evolved before the emergence of our species. 
The internal functioning of these systems depends on principles and processes that are 
distinctly non-intuitive.  Nevertheless, human intuitions about space, number, morality 
and other abstract concepts emerge from the use of symbols, especially language, to 
combine productively the representations that core systems deliver’

Interpretation is hard because there are two factors: truth and meaning.
The proposal Davidson makes is that we assume truth and infer meaning.
I'm recommending a similar strategy for core knowledge.
Very roughly, we take for granted that the evidence establishes various hypotheses.  We then 
ask what core knowledge could be given these are true.
But more carefully, we first have to ask what motivates talk about core knowledge at all.

But maybe we can appeal to the Core Knowledge View.

          <div class="notes">According to the Core Knowledge View, the principles of object perception, and maybe also the

          <div class="notes">This raises some issues.  Is the Core Knowledge View consistent with the claims that 
we have ended up with, e.g. about categorical perception and the Principles of Object 
Perception characterising the way that object indexes work?
I think the answer is, basically, yes.  Categorical perception involves a system that has
many of the features associated with core knowledge.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">[*revise this note:]
Consider this hypothesis.
The principles of object perception, and maybe also the expectations they give rise to, are not knowledge.
But they are core knowledge.
The \emph{core knowledge view}: the principles of object perception are not knowledge, but they are core knowledge.
But look at those features again --- innate, encapsulated, unchanging and the rest.
None of these straightforwardly enable us to predict that core knowledge of objects will guide looking but not reaching.
So the \emph{first problem} is that (at this stage) it's unclear what we gain by shifting from knowledge to core knowledge.

core system = module as a working assumption and then look to research on modularity

  <div class="notes">Not all researchers agree about the properties of modules.  That they are 
informationally encapsulated is denied by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson (2002: 9), 
Simon Baron-Cohen (1995) and some evolutionary psychologists (Buller and Hardcastle 2000: 309), 
whereas Scholl and Leslie claim that information encapsulation is the essence of modularity 
and that any other properties modules have follow from this one (1999b: 133; this also seems 
to fit what David Marr had in mind, e.g. Marr 1982: 100-1).  According to Max Coltheart, 
the key to modularity is not information encapsulation but domain specificity; he suggests 
Fodor should have defined a module simply as 'a cognitive system whose application is domain 
specific' (1999: 118).  Peter Carruthers, on the other hand, denies that domain specificity 
is a feature of all modules (2006: 6).  Fodor stipulated that modules are 
'innately specified' (1983: 37, 119), and some theorists assume that modules, 
if they exist, must be innate in the sense of being implemented by neural regions 
whose structures are genetically specified (e.g. de Haan, Humphreys and Johnson 2002: 207; 
Tanaka and Gauthier 1997: 85); others hold that innateness is 'orthogonal' to modularity 
(Karmiloff-Smith 2006: 568).  There is also debate over how to understand individual 
properties modules might have (e.g. Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994 on the meanings of domain 
specificity; Samuels 2004 on innateness).
  </div>
  <div class="notes">In short, then, theorists invoke many different notions of modularity, each barely different 
from others.  You might think this is just a terminological issue.  I want to argue that 
there is a substantial problem: we currently lack any theoretically viable account of what 
modules are.  The problem is not that 'module' is used to mean different things-after all, 
there might be different kinds of module.  The problem is that none of its various meanings 
have been characterised rigorously enough.  All of the theorists mentioned above except Fodor 
characterise notions of modularity by stipulating one or more properties their kind of module 
is supposed to have.  This way of explicating notions of modularity fails to support principled 
ways of resolving controversy.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">No key explanatory notion can be adequately characterised by listing properties because the 
explanatory power of any notion depends in part on there being something which unifies its 
properties and merely listing properties says nothing about why they cluster together.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">So much the same objections which applied to the very notion of core knowledge 
appear to recur for module.  But note one interesting detail ...

I'm not going to talk about the paper here; let me leave it like this:
if you want to invoke a notion of core knowledge or modularity,
you have to reply to these problems.  And one way to reply to them---
the only way I know---is to develop the idea that modules are a natural

But doesn't the bare appeal to limited accessibility leave open why the looking and not the searching (rather than conversely)?
I think not, given the assumption that searching is purposive in a way that looking is not.  (Searching depends on practical reasoning.)
We'll come back to this later (if core knowledge of objects involves object files, it's easier to see why it affects looking but not actions like reaching.)

  <div class="notes">Let me illustrate limited accessibility ...
  </div>
  <div class="notes">Limited accessbility is a familar feature of many cognitive systems.
When you grasp an object with a precision grip, it turns out that there is a very 
reliable pattern.
At a certain point in moving towards it your fingers will reach a maximum grip aperture 
which is normally a certain amount wider than the object to be grasped, and then start to close.
Now there's no physiological reason why grasping should work like this, rather than grip hand 
closing only once you contact the object.
Maximum grip aperture shows anticipation of the object: the mechanism responsible for 
guiding your action does so by representing various things including some features of 
the object.
But we ordinarily have no idea about this.
The discovery of how grasping is controlled depended on high speed photography.
This is an illustration of limited accessibility.
(This can also illustrate information encapsulation and domain specificity.)

(a) modules cover a wider range of domains than Carey or Spelke think core systems 
do (not just objects, number, geometry and the rest but also speech, colour
and mental states)
(b) there is less to say about what unifies any of these cases (maybe core knowledge
of objects has more in common with, say, categorical perception of colour than
with core knowledge of action.)

I think that thinking about categorical perception, or the perceptual

involves.  Core systems are not always something over and above perceptual and motor systems
(although it seems probably that they sometimes are if our competence with syntax rests on 
core knowledge).

          <div data-what=" .syntax" data-class="bkg-words-highlight-invert" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
          <div class="notes">First, what is this thing, syntax, which is known?</div>
          <div class="notes">This thing they know, the syntax, isn't plausibly just a list of which sentences are grammatical.</div>
          <div class="notes">Because people can make judgements about arbitrarily long, entirely novel sentences.</div>
          <div class="notes">Rather, the thing known must be something that enables people to make judgements about sentences.</div>
          <div class="notes">We might think of it roughly as a theory of syntax.</div>
          <div class="notes">It's like a theory in this sense: knowledge of it enables you to make judgements about the grammaticality of arbitrary sentences.</div>
          <div data-what=" .syntax" data-class="bkg-words-highlight-invert" class="slide anim-continue anim-removeclass"></div>
          <div data-what=" .knowledge" data-class="bkg-words-highlight-invert" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
          <div class="notes">The second question is, Is it *knowledge* we have syntax or something else?</div>
          <div class="notes">There's something interesting.</div>
          <div class="notes">The knowledge can be revealed indirectly, by asking people about whether particular sentences are grammatical.</div>
          <div class="notes">But people can't say anything about how they know the sentence is grammatical.</div>
          <div class="notes">It's like perceiving the shape of something: there isn't much to say about how you know.</div>
          <div class="notes">So the theory of syntax isn't something we can discover by introspection:</div>
          <div class="notes">we have to *rediscover* it from scratch by investigating people's linguistic abilities.</div>

          <div data-what=" .core" data-class="bkg-words-highlight-invert" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
          <div class="notes">Knowledge of syntax therefore seems to have some of the features associated with core knowledge.</div>
          <div class="notes">First, it is domain-specific.</div>
          <div class="notes">Second, it is inaccessible.  That is, it can't guide arbitrary actions.</div>
          <div class="notes">In what follows I want to suggest that syntax provides a paradigm case for thinking about core knowledge.</div>

          <div data-what=".step3" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
          <div class="notes">In addition, I want to use the case of syntax for thinking about the question, What is innate in humans?</div>
          <div class="notes">I was astonished how many people considered this question in the unassessed essay, some people seem really fascinated by it.</div>
          <div class="notes">But almost no one discussed the case of syntax in depth.  If you're going to talk about innateness, you really need to know a little bit about syntax.</div>
          <div class="notes">So I'm also going to provide you with that understanding.</div>

            <div data-what=".step2" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-removeclass"></div>
            <div class="notes">So the key question was whether infants would look more at the yellow bottle (which is familiar) or the blue bottle (which is novel).</div>
            <div class="notes">If they think 'one' refers to 'bottle', we'd expect them to look longer at the blue bottle;</div>
            <div class="notes">and conversely if they think one refers to 'yellow bottle', then they're being asked whether they see another yellow bottle.</div>

            <div class="notes">Quite a few people pointed out that there isn't agreement on what innateness is.</div>
            <div class="notes">But this is not very interesting by itself because there's disagreement about most things and potential causes of disagreement include ignorance and stupidity.</div>
            <div class="notes">It's also important that the mere fact that a single term is used with multiple meanings isn't an objection to anyone.</div>
            <div class="notes">As philosophers, some of you are tempted to catalogue different possible notions of innateness.</div>

            <div class="notes">So it's not unreasonable to conjecture that learning in the several domains where infants appear to know things early in their first year is innately-primed rather than entirely data-driven.</div>
            <div class="notes">But, one or two cases aside, there's enough evidence to rule out the converse conjecture.</div>

        <div class="notes">Here are two reasons why I think we shouldn't worry too much about innateness in trying to understand the origins of mind.  </div>
        <div class="notes">(1) The question about innateness concerns the first transition, whereas I think the second should be our focus (for pragmatic reasons: there's more research).</div>
        <div class="notes">
          (2) Discoveries about innately-primed learning make only a relatively modest contribution to understanding the emergence of core knowledge in development. 
          So even when we consider the first transition, it's not obvious that discoveries about innateness are very illuminating, for all their pop-science appeal.

        <div class="notes">Metaphor: we find a cake in the ruins of Pompeii preserved for a couple of thousand years.  We're trying to reconstruct its manufacture.</div>
        <div class="notes">Its good if someone obsesses about where the eggs came from.  Did the baker have her own chickens or did she get them from a friend?</div>
        <div class="notes">But knowing where the eggs came from is unlikely to be critical to understanding how the cake was manufactured.</div>
        <div class="notes">We're not finished when we know where the eggs came from, and we're not doomed to fail if we don't know.</div>

        <p>Conclusion</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Adults have inaccessible, domain-specific representations concerning the syntax of natural languages.</li>
          <li>So do infants (from 18 months of age or earlier, well before they can use the syntax in production).</li>
          <li><span>These representations plausibly enable understanding and play a key role in the development of abilities to communicate with language.</span></li>
          <li>These representations are a paradigm case of core knowledge.</li>
          <div data-what=" li:eq(2) span" data-class="bkg-words-highlight-limegreen" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div>
          <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
          <div class="notes">This paradigm allows me to highlight something about core knowledge.</div>
          <div class="notes">I would be a mistake to suppose that there is some core knowledge which later becomes knowledge proper --- e.g. the fact that barriers stop solid objects is first core knowledge then later knowledge.</div>
          <div class="notes">The content of the core knowledge is a theory of syntax (let's say).</div>
          <div class="notes">Or, in another case, the content of core knowledge is some principles of object perception.</div>
          <div class="notes">These are things that human adults do not typically know at all, at least not in the sense that they could state the principles.</div>
          <div class="notes">So core knowledge enables us to do things, like anticipate where unseen objects will re-appear or communicate with words.</div>
          <div class="notes">It doesn't seem to be linked directly to the acquisition of concepts.</div>
