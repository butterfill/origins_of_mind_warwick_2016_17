  <div class="notes">[I need to explain the method used in violation-of-expectations, and to compare it with
the method of habituation.]
A violation-of-expectations experiment involves a pair of events.
Infants are divided into two groups; one group sees one event, the other sees the other event.
(This is the between-subject version; it might also be done within subjects.)
The experimenter measures how long the infants look at each event.
Of interest is whether infants reliably look longer at one of the two events.
If they do, this is interpreted as evidence that this event---the one infants reliably look 
longer at---is in some way interesting to them. 
And, if the events are well chosen, their interest indicates that the event violates an
expectation they have.
In the experiment we are considering, the expectation violated is the expectation that 
the two objects should move separately.

        <p class="right">(Spelke 1990)</p>
        <div class="notes">Another principle which seems to be involved in segmenting objects is the principle of

According to this principle, ‘two surface points lie on the same object only if the points are

        <div class="notes">For example, objects arranged as on your left were percevied by 3-month-olds as two objects, 
whereas infants treated the displays like that on your right as if they were one object.
(This was measured using a habituation paradigm \citep{kestenbaum:1987_perception}.  Infants 
were habituated to the display.  Then either one object's position changed, or both objects' 
positions changed but in such a way as to preserve the overall configuration of the two 
objects.  Infants could show that they perceived the configuration as a single object by 
looking longer when just one object's position changed.)

        <div class="notes">Here's a second example using moving rather than static stimuli and a different method: 
reaching rather than looking.
Let me explain the stimuli first.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">How does the principle of cohension apply to this moving display? 
As we just formulated it, it doesn't seem to.  After all, in both cases all points on the 
stimuli are lnked by a path of connected surface points.
However, the principle should be read as saying more implying that:
‘When two surfaces are separated by a spatial gap (as in Figure 4a) or undergo relative motions 
that alter the adjacency relations among points at their border (as in Figure 4i), the 
surfaces lie on distinct objects’ \citep[p.\ 49]{Spelke:1990jn}.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The question is, Do infants segment these objects in accordance with the Principle of Cohesion?
\citet[Experiment 2]{spelke:1989_reaching} used a reaching experiment with 5-month-old infants.
The smaller of the two objects was always closer to the infants.  
Infants should reach more often for the smaller, nearer object when they represent the simuli 
as two separate objects than when they represent it as a single object.
(This is not obvious, but the researchers do justify this claim carefully 
\citep[p.\ 186]{spelke:1989_reaching}.)
So the idea is that by comparing how often 5-month-olds reach for the smaller object, we can
see whether they treat it as a separate object in one case but not the other.
To make this vivid, let me show you their apparatus ...

[*explain within- vs between-subject].

Overall, infants reached to the smaller, top object more often when they moved in opposite 
directions than when they moved together.
Given the background assumption, this is evidence that infants segmented the objects 
differently depending on their motions, and did so in just the way that adults would
\citep[Experiment 2]{spelke:1989_reaching}.

Strictly speaking, cohension allows us to infer that we have two 
distinct objects, but not to infer that we have a single object---for that, we need boundedness.
So when I was talking a moment ago about the Principle of Cohesion, strictly speaking I was 
also appealing to the Principle of Boundedness.

        <div class="notes">I don't want to obsess too much about the details of these principles.  
It isn't important that there are exactly four, nor are their precise formulations.
(Surely the principles as stated here are not exactly the principles we need to characterise
how infants segment objects.)
What I want us to focus on is just the fact that we can use a small number of principles to 
characterise how infants segment objects in a way that generates testable predictions,
and these principles have been confirmed.
This motivates us to ask ...
        </div>
        <div class="handout notes">What is the status of these principles?</div>
        <div class="notes">Spelke’s position might be put like this:</div>
        <div class="handout notes">\begin{enumerate}

\item We (as perceivers) start with a cross-modal representation of three-dimensional 
perceptual features which includes their locations and trajectories.

\item Our task is to get from these representations of features to representations of objects.

\item \emph{Descriptive component} We do this as if in accordance with certain principles 
(cohesion, boundedness, rigidity, and no action at a distance).

\item \emph{Explanatory component}  We acquire representations of objects because we apply the 
principles to representations of features and draw appropriate inferences.

\end{enumerate}
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The key point for our purposes is the explanatory component.
The principles are not supposed to be merely heuristics for describing and predicting infants’ 
performance on preferential looking tasks.
Rather, these principles are supposed to explain why infants look longer at some things than at 
others.
This what motivates the hypothesis that infants know these principles and use them in 
reasoning about objects: unless this hypothesis is true, it’s hard to understand how the 
principles could have explanatory relevance.

          <p class="center">Marr & Chomsky</p>
          <div class="notes">Inspiration for Spelke’s view comes from Marr and Chomsky.
Marr showed that many visual processes can be modelled as inferences.
And Chomsky pioneered the idea that our knowledge of language depends on knowledge of 
principles of syntax.
What unites these three cases, Spelke on object segmentation, Marr on vision and Chomsky on 
syntax?
It’s that they are straightforwardly cognitivist in appeal to knowledge and inference.
Principles are known, and they are used via a process of inference.
(There’s a nice quote from Fodor on your handout underlining this point.)
          </div>
          <div class="handout notes">‘Chomsky’s nativism is primarily a thesis about knowledge and belief; it aligns problems 
in the theory of language with those in the theory of knowledge.  Indeed, as often as not, 
the vocabulary in which Chomsky frames linguistic issues is explicitly epistemological.  
Thus, the grammar of a language specifies what its speaker/hearers have to know qua speakers 
and hearers; and the goal of the child’s language acquisition process is to construct a 
theory of the language that correctly expresses this grammatical knowledge.’

          <div class="notes">So what is the status of Spelke’s principles of object perception?
Consider what I shall call the Simple View ...
          </div>
          <div class="handout notes">\textbf{The simple view}
The principles of object perception are things that we know or believe, 
and we generate expectations from these principles by a process of inference.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">The simple view is that the Spelke principles are just known in whatever sense anything is 
known or believed.
(We can't say the principles are known because strictly speaking they are not truths but only
heuristics.)
The simple view isn’t exactly Spelke’s, but it’s a useful starting point for discussion.
          </div>
          <div class="slide blur1">
            <div class="notes">The Simple View is worth considering in its own right because it is so, well, simple.
But our interest in it may be piqued by the fact that   
Spelke herself appears to have accepted the Simple View at one point in her thinking:
            </div>
            <p class="handout notes show">‘objects are conceived: Humans come to know about an object’s unity, boundaries, and 
persistence in ways like those by which we come to know about its material composition or its 
market value’

          <div class="notes">Now you might think that the case for these principles is not yet very strong.
In that case, asking hard questions about their status would hardly be necessary.
So let’s consider further evidence for these principles.
We can do this by turning from segmentation (which was our first requirement on knowledge of 
objects) 
to representing objects as permanent.
