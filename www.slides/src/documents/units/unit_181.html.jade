  .notes: :t()
    I'm presenting this experiment as showing that infants represent objects as persisting, and do so
    in accordance with the Principle of Continuity.  However, the experiment is also about 
    causal interactions between objects.  After all, infants are demonstrating sensitivity to
    the fact that a solid object must stop the drawbridge from rotating all the way back.
  .notes: :t()
    Some have been critical of the methods used in this experiment.
    But not everything hangs on this experiment.
    Fortunately there are at least a hundred further experiments which provide evidence pointing in the same direction.
    Here we'll look at just one more experiment.

  .notes Here is another way of demonstrating object permanence.

    This experiment will suggest, incidentally, that the principles we have seen---continuity,
    rigidity and the rest---don't fully explain how infants succeed in representing objects as persisting.
  .notes The subjects were 4 month old infants.
  .notes They were shown a large object disappearing inside a small conatiner, or behind a narrow screen.

    By the way, this experiment is interesting partly because it doesn't use habituation, as 
    Baillargeon's earlier drawbridge experiment did.
    It is also hard to explain the result by appeal only to the Principle of Object Perception
    that we have so far listed.

  .notes: :t()
    We're considering abilities to represent objects as persisting even when not perceived. 
    Where are we?
    We've seen that characteristing these abilities in terms of Principles of Object Perception
    enables us to make testable predictions, many of which have been confirmed.
    Importantly, we made the same claim about these Principles for abilities to segment objects.
    The abilities to segment objects and to represent them as persisting are conceptually 
    distinct.
    However it may be that beliefs about a single set of principles underlies both abilities.
    This is one of Spelke's brilliant insights.
  .notes: :t()
    Where does this leave us?
    We still want to know about the status of the principles of object perception.
    As I said before, it is one thing to say they are descriptively adequate and another thing
    to understand how the Princples relate to cognitive mechanisms (processes and 
    representations).
    But now the question about the status of these Principles is more pressing because 
    the claim that these principles of object perception explain infants' (and adults', 
    and other primates') performance is now harder to reject.
    It's harder to reject because we have converging evidence for the psychological reality of 
    the principles from both segmentation and permanence.

     On the status of the Principles, consider this claim about the interpretation of the 
     results of a violation-of-expectation experiment: 
  .handout.notes: :t()
    ‘evidence that infants look reliably longer at the unexpected than at the expected event is 
    taken to indicate that they (1) possess the expectation under investigation; (2) detect the 
    violation in the unexpected event; and (3) are surprised by this violation. The term 
    surprise is used here simply as a short-hand descriptor, to denote a state of heightened 
    attention or interest caused by an expectation violation.’ \citep[p.\ 168]{wang:2004_young}

    What does ‘surprise’ mean here?

  .notes: :t()
    So this is not surprise in a sense that requires awareness of a change in one's own beliefs.
    It is rather that there is a particular way in which the detection of the violation is 
    manifested.

  .notes: :t()
    Note that we are talking about expectations.
    This raises two questions: How do we arrive at these expectations? and What is an 
    expectation?
    Spelke's claim is that we arrive at these expectations by inference from the Principles of 
    Object Perception, including the principle of contintuity.
    So what is an expectation?  
    On the simple view we are adopting for now, an expectation is just a belief.
    The attraction of this simple view is it allows us to take literally the claim that we know 
    the principles of object perception and arrive at expectations by a process of inference.
