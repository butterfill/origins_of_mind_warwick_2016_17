and that the term is rarely defined explicitly anyway.
I've put a recent quote from Spelke and Lee on your handout to illustrate 
a different idea.
          </div>
          <div class="handout">‘We hypothesize that uniquely human cognitive achievements build on systems that humans 
share with other animals: core systems that evolved before the emergence of our species. 
The internal functioning of these systems depends on principles and processes that are 
distinctly non-intuitive.  Nevertheless, human intuitions about space, number, morality 
and other abstract concepts emerge from the use of symbols, especially language, to 
combine productively the representations that core systems deliver’

          <div class="notes">How does radical interpretation work?
Interpretation is hard because there are two factors: truth and meaning.
The proposal Davidson makes is that we assume truth and infer meaning.
I'm recommending a similar strategy for core knowledge.
Very roughly, we take for granted that the evidence establishes various hypotheses.  We then 
ask what core knowledge could be given these are true.
But more carefully, we first have to ask what motivates talk about core knowledge at all.

we have ended up with, e.g. about categorical perception and the Principles of Object 
Perception characterising the way that object indexes work?
I think the answer is, basically, yes.  Categorical perception involves a system that has
many of the features associated with core knowledge.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">[*revise this note:]
Consider this hypothesis.
The principles of object perception, and maybe also the expectations they give rise to, are not knowledge.
But they are core knowledge.
The \emph{core knowledge view}: the principles of object perception are not knowledge, but they are core knowledge.
But look at those features again --- innate, encapsulated, unchanging and the rest.
None of these straightforwardly enable us to predict that core knowledge of objects will guide looking but not reaching.
So the \emph{first problem} is that (at this stage) it's unclear what we gain by shifting from knowledge to core knowledge.
