        <div class="notes">In Fodor's terminology, a relation between representations is context dependent if whether it holds between two of your representations may depend, in arbitrarily complex ways, on which other mental representations you have.  For our purposes, what matters is that the relation … is adequate evidence for me to accept that … is a context dependent relation.  This is because almost anything you know might be relevant to determining what counts as adequate evidence for accepting the truth of a conclusion.  Knowing that Sarah missed the conference is (let's suppose) adequate evidence for you to conclude that she is ill … until you discover that she couldn't resist visiting a cheese factory, or that she urgently needs to finish writing a paper.  So the adequate evidence relation is context dependent.  But since thinking requires sensitivity to whether evidence is adequate, some of the processes involved in thinking must be sensitive to context dependent relations.  So not all of the processes involved in thinking could be computational processes of the kind Fodor envisages.  This is why the Computational Theory fails as an account of how we think.</div>

  <div class="notes">This proposal departs from Fodor's overall strategy.  Fodor starts by asking what thinking is, and answers that it's a special kind of Computational process.  He then runs into the awkward problem that such Computation only happens in modules, if at all.  Instead of taking this line, we started by asking what modularity is.  The answer I'm suggesting is that modular cognition is a Computational process.  On this way of looking at things, that such Computation only happens in modules is a useful result because enables us to identify what is distinctive of modular cognition.</div>

          <p class="em-above step3 hide">2b. The principles of object perception result in ‘expectations’ in infants.  What is the nature of these expectations?</p>
          <p class="em-above step1">3. What is the relation between adults’ and infants’ abilities concerning physical objects and their causal interactions?</p>
          <div class="notes">With respect to the third question, we have made no progress unless we assume that modules are continuous throughout development.  But our little theory of modularity doesn't tell us this.</div>
          <div data-what=".step1" data-class="blur-text" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div>
          <div data-what=".step2" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-continue anim-removeclass"></div>
          <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
          <div class="notes">With respect to question 2a, our claim is that the principles are not knowledge but core knowledge, or modular representations; or else that they describe the operations of a module.</div>
          <div class="notes">Note that we have yet to say which module they describe.</div>
          <div class="notes">At this point, we suppose they are part of a sui generis module that is concerned with physical objects and their causal interactions.</div>
          <div data-what=".step2" data-class="blur-text" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div>
          <div data-what=".step3" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-continue anim-removeclass"></div>
          <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
          <div class="notes">With respect to question 2b, again the idea is that the expectations are modular representations.</div>
          <div data-what=".step3" data-class="blur-text" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div>
          <div data-what=".step4" data-class="hide" data-scope="" class="slide anim-continue anim-removeclass"></div>
          <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
          <div class="notes">And with respect to question 1, our current answer is that humans meet the three requirements (abilities to segment, &c) by virtue of a module or core knowledge system that is in place from around six months of age or earlier.</div>
