    The challenge is to explain the developmental emergence of mindreading.
  .notes Let me explain.

    .notes.handout: :t
      \textit{Mindreading} is 
      the process of 
      identifying mental states and purposive actions 
      as the mental states and purposive actions of a particular subject.

    .notes Researchers sometimes use the term ‘theory of mind’.

      span ‘In saying that an individual has a 
      span.theory-of-mind theory of mind,
      span  we mean that the individual imputes mental states to himself and to others’

      So, to be clear about the terminology, to have a theory of mind is just to be able to
      to mindread,
      that is, to identify mental states and purposive actions  
      as the mental states and purposive actions of a particular subject.

      So the challenge is to explain the emergence of mindreading.
      You know (let's say) that Ayesha belives Beatrice is in the library.
      Humans are not born knowing individuating facts about others' beliefs.
      How do they come to be in a position to know such facts?
      Meeting this challenge initially seems simple.
      But, as you'll see, we quickly end up with a puzzle.
      I think this puzzle requires us to rethink what is involved in having a conception of
      the mental.

  .notes I shall focus on awareness of others' beliefs to the exclusion of other mental states.
  .notes There's no theoretical reason for this; it's just a practical thing.
  .notes And what we learn about belief will generalise to other mental states.

  .notes Here's the really surprising thing.
  .notes Children do really badly on this until they are around four years of age.
  .notes And they seem to develop the ability to pass this task only gradually, over months or years.
  .notes (There's something else that isn't surprising to most people but should be: adult humans not only nearly always provide the answer we're calling 'correct': they also believe that there is an obviously correct answer and that it would be a mistake to give any other answer.  I'll return to this point later.)

  .notes There's been some stuff in the press recently about bad science, mainly some dodgy methods and failures to replicate.

  .notes So you'll be pleased to know that a meta-study of 178 papers confirmed Wimmer & Perner's findings.

  .notes Now there is clearly some variation here.
  .notes That's because different researchers implemented different versions of the original task.
  .notes We can use the meta-analysis of these experiments as a shortcut to finding out what sorts of factors affect children's performance.
  
+slide
  .notes One factor that seems to make hardly any difference is whether you ask children about others' beliefs or their own beliefs.
  .notes To repeat, you get essentially the same results whether you ask children about others' beliefs or their own beliefs.
  .notes Children literally do not know their own minds.

  .notes What happens if we involve the child by having her interact with the protagonist?
  .notes The task becomes easier for children of all ages, but the transition is essentially the same 
    | (participation does not interact with age \citealp[pp.\ 665-7]{Wellman:2001lz}).

    So our challenge was to explain the emergence of mindreading.
    At this point, up until around, it seemed quite straightforward to most researchers.
    We seemed to know that children are unaware of mental states until around four years.
    And a lot of studies looked at which factors affect their acquiring this awareness.
    These studies showed that executive function, language and rich forms of social
    interaction are all important.
    All of this supported something like the story that Sellars tells in his famous Myth of
    Jones.

  Three-year-olds systematically fail to predict actions \citep{Wimmer:1983dz}
  and desires \citep{Astington:1991kk} based on false beliefs; they similarly
  fail to retrodict beliefs \citep{Wimmer:1998kx} and to select arguments
  suitable for agents with false beliefs \citep{Bartsch:2000es}.
  They fail some low-verbal and nonverbal false belief tasks
  \citealp{Call:1999co,low:2010_preschoolers,krachun:2009_competitive,krachun:2010_new}; they fail whether the question concerns others' or their own (past)
  false beliefs \citep{Gopnik:1991db}; and they fail whether they are
  interacting or observing \citep{Chandler:1989qa}.
