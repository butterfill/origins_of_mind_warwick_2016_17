What do six- or twelve-month-old infants understand of actions and their goals?
          </div>
          <div class="notes">It's essential to see that there's a question here.
We've shown that infants from around six months of age can track differences that are in fact 
differences in the actions.
But we haven't shown how infants understand these differences; we haven't said how actions 
appear from the point of view of the infant.

          <p class="center">What is a model of action?</p>
          <div class="notes">To answer this question we need to step back and ask a more basic one: What is a model of 
action?
          </div>

  <div class="notes">The key to answering this question (what is a model of action?) is to understand what a model
of action needs to achieve.
Part or all of what is needs to achieve is a specification of how purposive actions are related 
to their goals.
That is, the model has to answer this question:
What is the relation between an action and the outcome or outcomes to which it is directed?
  </div>
</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture05_04.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">One feature of actions is that, among all their actual and possible outcomes, some are goals to 
which they are directed.
I seize little Isabel by the wrists and swing her around, thereby  making her laugh and 
breaking a vase.
You might wonder what the goal of my action was.
Did I act in order to break the  vase or to make Isabel laugh?
Or was my action perhaps directed to some other goal, one that was not realised so that my 
action failed?
  </div>
  <div class="notes">A model of action has to specify the relation between actions and the 
goal or goals to which they are directed.
That is, it has to answer this question:
Among all of the actual and possible outcomes of an action, which are goals of the action?
  </div>
</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture05_05.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">The standard answer to this question involves intention.
An intention (1) represents an outcome, (2) causes an event; and (3) causes an event whose 
occurrence would normally lead to the outcome’s occurrence.
What singles out an actual or possible outcome as one to which the component actions are 
collectively directed?  It is the fact that this outcome is represented by the intention.
  </div>
</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture05_07.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">Note, by the way, that goals are not intentions.
Goals are actual or possible outcomes.
They are states of affairs.
Intentions, by contrast, are or involve mental states that represent a goal; they are a 
variety of goal-states.
It would be a terrible mistake to confuse a goal with a goal-state.
That would be like confusing a person with a photograph.
  </div>
</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture05_05.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">So, on one model of action,
the intention is what links an action to the outcomes to which it is directed.
Is this the model of action that infants' actually use?

        <p class="notes show">Does infants’ model involve intentions?</p>
        <div class="notes">Our question is, How do infants model actions?  
One possibility is that they use an adult commonsense model involving intentions.
According to this model, 
actions are events appropriately related to intentions 
and whether something is a goal of an action is determined by the contents of those intentions.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
          <div class="notes">\citet{Premack:1990jl} endorses this possibility.  He writes:
          </div>
          <p class="em-above">Yes: <span class="handout notes show"><span>‘in perceiving one object as having the intention of affecting another, the infant </span><span class="intentions">attributes to the object [...] intentions</span><span>’</span></span></p>
          <p class="right">Premack 1990: 14</p>

          <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
          <div class="handout notes ctd">\citep[p.\ 14]{Premack:1990jl}</div>
          <div class="notes">By contrast, Geregely et al reject this possibility ...</div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
          <p class="em-above">No: <span class="handout notes show"><span>‘by taking the intentional stance the infant can come to represent the agent’s action as </span><span>intentional </span><span class="no-intention1">without actually attributing a mental representation </span><span>of the future goal state’</span></span></p>
          <p class="right">Gergely et al 1995, p. 188</p>
          <div class="handout notes ctd">\citep[p.\ 188]{Gergely:1995sq}</div>

          <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
          <div class="notes">Btw, it isn't clear that this proposal can work (as introduced by Dennett, the intentional stance 
involves ascribing mental states), as these authors probably realised later, but the point 
about not representing mental states is good.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">Finally, \citet{woodward:2001_making} offer a mixed view:
infants do think about intentions, but don't have the same model of intention that adults do.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
          <p class="em-above sort-of">Sort of:<span class="handout notes show"><span>‘to the extent that young infants are limited [...], </span><span class="no-intention2">their understanding of intentions would be quite different from the mature concept of intentions</span><span>’</span></span></p>
          <p class="right sort-of">Woodward et al 2001, p. 168</p>
          <div class="handout notes ctd">\citep[p.\ 168]{woodward:2001_making}</div>

          <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
          <div class="notes">This isn't a very useful view for our purposes because it doesn't involve specifying a model.
It merely says that the model, whatever it is, isn't the one that we already have some 
understanding of. 
Not very helpful.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div data-what=".sort-of" data-class="blur-text" class="slide anim-continue anim-addclass"></div>
        <div data-what="#notanelement" data-class="" class="slide anim-addclass"></div>
        <div class="notes">I'm going to discount this view because it's not helpful at all.
In what follows I will first consider Premark's view and then the alternative.
This is worthwhile because each group takes a different view of how infants model actions 
and there don't seem to be arguments anywhere.
