When do humans first come to know simple facts about particular physical objects?
To illustrate, consider the fact that this telephone is located here,
or the fact that this telephone is square.
I take it that no one is born knowing any such facts.
So there was a time when you knew no facts about particular physical objects at all,
and then, sometime later, you came to know some such facts.
How did you make this transition?
How do humans first come to know facts about particular objects?

First, what does knowledge of physical objects involve?
One way to approach this question is by contrasting objects with features.
Physical objects contrast with features in three ways
%
\begin{enumerate}
%
\item physical objects have boundaries whereas mere features do not. (This needs qualifying 
because there is a sense in which we can regard features as having boundaries; but when it 
comes to 
features, the boundaries are merely projections.  To see the contrast, consider that we could 
all be permanently mistaken about the boundaries of a physical object but not about the 
boundaries of a feature---another species could not discover a million years from now that 
humans are wrong about the boundaries of this feature, that they thought it was one feature
whereas really it is two.)
%
\item physical objects persist in a way that features do not.  You cannot ask, concerning a 
feature now, whether this is the same feature as some time ago.  At least, you cannot ask this
in the same sense that you can ask it about a physical objects.
%
\item physical objects can interact with each other in way that features cannot: they
can causally interact.
%
\end{enumerate}
%
Imagine not knowing anything at all about particular physical objects and living in a world
consisting entirely of features.  Nothing interacts, there are only patterns.
And things outside your perceptual field do not exist.
From your point of view, the world is limited your perceptual field now.

The way objects are ordinarily arranged in space, so that one occludes parts of another, 
prevents us from doing this in any simple way.

  <div class="notes">[features picture]
Recall my imaginary world of features.  In this world there is no principled way of saying 
where one object ends and another begins.
As I said, features differ from genuine objects in not allowing us to make sense of the question of 
whether we are carving them at their joints.
So an ability to segment physical objects is not necessary for knowing anything about
mere features but it is probably necessary for having any knowledge 
concerning particular physical objects.

Contrast features again.  You might see this red feature moving across the scene. 
But suppose it disappears and then, later a similar looking feature appears. 
There is no fact of the matter about whether this is the same feature or a different one.
As I mentioned before, in the case of features we can't make sense of them as persisting over 
time, or as there being interruptions in their presence.
I suppose, then, that to have knowledge concerning physical objects rather than merely 
concerning features, it is necessary to be able to represent objects as persisting
even while unperceived.

  <div class="notes">Objects causally interact with each other; one pan supports another, two people collide and 
bounce off each other.  Relatedly, objects have counterfactual lives: sometimes you can say,
truly, that if that barrier had not been there, the car would be at the bottom of the valley 
now.

</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/PB042152.JPG" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">[features picture]
As I mentioned, this is another respect in which objects are distinct from features.
Features do not causally interact with each other and they do not have counterfactual lives 
either.
This point of contrast suggests that knowledge concerning physical objects as opposed to mere
features requires at least a limited ability to track causal interactions.

  <div class="notes">So reflection on how physical objects differ from mere features suggests three minimal 
requirements on having any knowledge at all of facts about particular physical objects.
Knowing things about particular physical objects, unlike knowing things about mere features, 
requires abilities to segment objects, to represent them as persisting, and to track at least 
some of their cauasl interactions.
