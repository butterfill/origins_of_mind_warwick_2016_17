As we'll see, we can find an answer to the first question by thinking about the second.

e.g. impetus vs Newtonian mechanics, is closely related to the question of how you make 
predictions about objects' movements and interactions.)

          <div class="notes">In looking for an alternative model of action we are also asking, How could pure goal 
ascription work?
Could you maybe think about the goal and not the intention and that would be enough?
Well no because a goal is just an outcome.  Let me try to explain with an example ...
          </div>
        </div>

<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture06_019.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">Earlier I said that \dfGoalAscription{}
Given this definition, goal ascription involves three things:
\begin{enumerate}
\item representing an action
\item representing an outcome
\end{enumerate}
and
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item capturing the directedness of the action to the outcome.
\end{enumerate}
&nbsp;
  </div>
  <div class="notes">It is important to see that the third item---capturing directedness---is necessary.
This is quite simple but very important, so let me slowly explain why goal ascription requires 
representing the directedness of an action to an outcome.
Imagine two people, Ayesha and Beatrice, who each intend to break an egg.
Acting on her intention, Ayesha breaks her egg.
But Beatrice accidentally drops her egg while carrying it to the kitchen.
  </div>
</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture06_020.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">So Ayesha and Beatrice perform visually similar actions which result in the same type of outcome, the breaking of an egg; 
but Beatrice's action is not directed to the outcome of her action whereas Ayesha's is.
  </div>
</section>
<section class="slide"><img src="/img/slide_budapest_lecture06_021.jpg" class="bkg"/>
  <div class="notes">Goal ascription requires the ability to distinguish between Ayesha's action and Beatrice's 
action. 
This requires representing not only actions and outcomes but also the directedness of actions 
to outcomes.
  </div>
  <div class="notes">This is why I say that goal ascription requires capturing the directedness of an action to an 
outcome, and not just representing the action and the outcome.

suppose that I walk over here with the goal of being next to you.

\item I will expend some energy.
\item I will be further away from the front
\end{itemize}
These are all causal consequence of my action.
But they are not goals to which my action is directed.
So this version of $R$ will massively over-generate goals.

How could we tell whether an action happens \emph{because} it brought about a particular 
outcome in the past? 
This might be done with insects.
But it can's so easily be done with primates, who have a much broader repertoire of actions
and wider range of motivations.

The problem is that we primates can perform old actions in order to achieve novel goals.
In such cases there will be a mismatch between the goals of our actions and their teleological 
functions.
Maybe we should allow that this idea will sometimes enable goal ascription to succeed,
but it will probably not allow for a very wide range of goals to be correctly ascribed.

        <div class="notes">What do we mean by `better means'?
Problem with defining $R$ in terms of rationality is requirement of core knowledge / modularity.
So what about efficiency instead of rationality?
One problem with defining $R$ in terms of minimising energy is that in 
acting we often face a trade off between how much energy to put into an action and how likely 
the action is to result in success.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Suppose I can save some energy by throwing the cup at the sink instead of walking over and 
carefully placing it in the sink,
and suppose that I choose to walk over and place the cup in the sink.
In this situation the principle of efficiency fails to identify $G$, placing the cup in the 
sink, as the goal of my action.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">One way to address this problem might be to think of efficiency in terms of achieving a good trade-off between several factors:
not just energy but also the probability that a particular action will in fact result in the goal being achieved.
This is the idea I am trying to get at here ...
        </div>
        <div class="notes">An action of type $a'$ is a better means of realising outcome $G$ in a given situation than an action of type $a$ if, for instance, actions of type $a'$ normally involve less effort than actions of type $a$ </div>

        <div class="notes">A problem with what we have so far is side-effects, which can be highly reliable.</div>
        <div class="notes">Actions typically have side-effects which are not goals.  For example,</div>
        <div class="notes">suppose that I walk over here with the goal of being next to you.</div>
        <div class="notes">This action has lots of side-effects: </div>
        <div class="notes">\begin{itemize}</div>

        <div class="notes">These  are not goals to which my action is directed.</div>
        <div class="notes">But they are things which my action would be a rational and efficient way of bring about.</div>

  <div class="notes">This is the probem.
How good is the agent at optimising the rationality, or the efficiency, of her actions?
And how good is the observer at identifying the optimality of actions in relation to outcomes?
\textbf{
For the relation to be readily detectible, we want there to be a match between
(i) how well the agent can optimise her actions
and
(i) how well the observer can detect optimality.}
Failing such a match, the relation R will either not be detectible or not be reliable.

complex detection.  But this threatens the ready detectibility of the relation.
