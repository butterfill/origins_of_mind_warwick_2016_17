          <div class="notes">In answer to Q2, I suggested that we start with the Simple View.  </div>
          <div class="notes handout">The \emph{Simple View} is the view that the principles of object perception are things that we know or believe, and we generate expectations from these principles by a process of inference.</div>
          <div class="notes">The attraction of the simple view is that it promises to explain infants' sensitivity to 
objects' boundaries, their persistence and their causal interactions as manifested in a variety 
of looking behaviours.

        <div class="notes">The problem for the simple view is that it makes exactly the wrong prediction about infants' 
reaching behaviours.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">This problem arises twice, once for object permanence and again for causal interactions.
Take object permanence first.  In this case the problem is 
that four and five month old infants appear to be surprised when a solid object is placed 
behind a drawbridge 
and then the drawbridge rotates back 180 degrees as if the object wasn't there.  
But if you put a desirable object behind a screen, these infants won't ever search behind the 
screen for the object. 
So if we measure their looking behaviours, they seem to know that an object is behind the 
screen; but if we measure their searching behaviours they seem not to know this.

      <div class="grid_12">
        <div class="notes">As I keep saying, 
the problem for the Simple View is that it correctly predicts looking behaviours but not 
searching behaviours.
This problem arises a second time in the case of infants' abilities to track causal 
interactions.
Suppose you roll a ball down this ramp and remove it from behind one of the doors.
You can predict where the ball will stop because you can see this barrier sticking up here.
2 and 2.5 year olds will look longer if you remove it from any door other than the right one.
These children and infants can also predict the location of the object (not just identify a 
violation, but look forward to where the object is) \citep{mash:2006_what}.
But if you ask them to remove the ball (and offer them a reward for doing so), 
the two year olds will typically choose a favourite door to open every time regardless of where 
the barrier is.  
(Incidentally this is not random but seems to be based on momentum 
\citep{perry:2008_representational}.) 
And the 2.5 year olds will choose a door adjacent to the barrier but do not prefer the door on 
the correct side of the barrier.
        </div>
        <div class="notes">The failure to reach is a problem for the Simple View because it predicts that children will 
correctly retrieve the ball.

but they do represent them.  This move involves making some assumptions, but I think it is a 
good move as far as it goes.
The problem is that it doesn't go very far.
Representation is a highly abstract notion. 
Knowledge and belief are types of representation, and there are many other kinds.
In order to make predictions, we need to say what kind of representation underpins
infants' competence.

It doesn't arise only in the case of knowledge of objects but also in other domains (like knowledge of number and knowledge of mind).
And it doesn't arise only from evidence about infants or nonhuman primates; it would also arise if our focus were exclusively on human adults.
More on this later.

The discovery of infant abilities presents us with a dilemma.
If we follow researchers like Michael Tomasello in dismissing infants' abilities to focus on 
social interactions, culture and language, we miss something important about the origins of 
knowledge.  We will miss the fact that coming to know things about physical objects (and 
colours, and mind and more besides) involves multiple layers of representation.
But if we follow researchers like Spelke and Baillargeon is discussing infants' abilities as 
if they were based on knowledge, belief and inference, we will also miss something important 
about the origins of knowledge.  We will miss the fact that infants' abilities, although 
essential for later developments, are only indirectly related to the knowledge of physical 
objects that adult humans enjoy.
The challenge is to avoid this dilemma, to provide a theoretical framework that will allow us 
to understand how infants' abilities support the emergence of knowledge without themselves 
amounting to knowledge.

        <div class="notes">So, at the risk of confusing you, this lecture is going to be about three things.
On the first, there are two issues:
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Given that the simple view is wrong, what is the relation between the principles of object perception and infants’ competence in segmenting objects, object permanence and tracking causal interactions?</div>
        <div class="notes">The principles of object perception result in ‘expectations’ in infants.  What is the nature of these expectations?</div>
        <div class="notes">The second is just the question, How do humans first acquire knowledge of particular causal 
interactions among objects?
        </div>
        <div class="notes">And the third is What is the relation between adults’ and infants’ abilities concerning physical objects and their causal interactions?
        </div>
        <div class="notes">I'm going to approach these indirectly, by asking a question about perception of causation.
This won't seem relevant yet, but it will become relevant.
