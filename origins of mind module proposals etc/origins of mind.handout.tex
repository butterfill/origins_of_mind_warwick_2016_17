\section{The Challenge}
Explain how humans come to know about objects, causes, words, numbers, colours, actions and minds.

\section{What will I learn about?}
Recent scientific breakthroughs about the emergence of minds in development, and the philosophical issues arising from these.

Also issues like innateness, modularity and pre-linguistic cognition.

\section{How is it organised?}
The course will be organised around domains of knowledge.
Some the topics to be covered may include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Social Interaction without Words
\item Objects and How They Interact
\item Numbers
\item Seeing and Talking about Colours
\item Words and Other Communicative Tools
\item Actions: Teleology and Motor Awareness
\item Mindreading
\end{enumerate}


\section{Do I have to know something about science?}
No but you will learn to read scientific papers papers, and consume quite a bit of developmental psychology.
You will also learn to integrate philosophy with psychology.


%\section{What are the requirements?}
%I assume you’ve done some philosophy or some psychology.



\section{Is there a web page?}
http://origins-of-mind.butterfill.com

Currently this page contains materials from an earlier version of the module.  I will update it as the module progresses.

\section{Can you suggest some reading?}
There’s a list on the back of this handout.

\section{Reading Suggestions by Topic}

These are some of the topics which may be covered in the module.

\subsection{1. Social Interaction without Words}
Could social interaction enable cognitive development? 
\citep{Moll:2007gu,
meltzoff:1977_imitation,
Csibra:2008be,
Baldwin:2000qq,
Liszkowski:2008al,
tomasello:2008origins}


\subsection{2. Objects and How They Interact}
\label{ch:objects}
When can infants first know things about objects they aren't perceiving?\citep{Meltzoff:1998wp,
baillargeon:1985_object,
Fodor:1983dg}



\subsection{3. Numbers}

How might abilities based on core knowledge enable the emergence in development of knowledge proper?\citep{
xu:2000_large,
wynn:1992_addition,
Fodor:1981ep,
carey:2009_origin}



\subsection{4. Seeing and Talking about Colours}
How do children acquire colour concepts and colour words---concepts and words for red, blue and green, say?\citep{Soja:1994np,
franklin:2010_hemispheric,
Franklin:2005hp}



\subsection{5. Words and Other Communicative Tools}
What comes first in development, knowledge or language?\citep{Wittgenstein:1974dk,
Bloom:2000qz,
Senghas:2001zm,
Goldin-Meadow:2003pj} 




\subsection{6. Actions: Teleology and Motor Awareness}
Which events do infants take to be actions?
And how do they understand the relation between actions and the goals to which they are directed?\citep{Bratman:1987xw,Csibra:1998cx,
rizzolatti_functional_2010,
bekkering:2000_imitation}

\subsection{7. Mindreading}
What is involved in representing belief?\citep[]{Onishi:2005hm, Southgate:2007js,kovacs_social_2010,
Davidson:1990du}
